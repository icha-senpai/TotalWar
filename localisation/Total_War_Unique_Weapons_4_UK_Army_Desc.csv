############### BRITISH ARMY UNIQUE WEAPONS ####################;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105500;New Rifle Design: The Lee Enfield .303inch Bolt Action Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105500;The Lee–Enfield bolt-action, magazine-fed, repeating rifle was the main firearm used by the military forces of the British Empire and Commonwealth during the first half of the 20th century. It was the British Army's standard rifle from its official adoption in 1895 until 1957.  A redesign of the Lee–Metford (adopted by the British Army in 1888), the Lee–Enfield superseded the earlier Martini–Henry, Martini–Enfield, and Lee–Metford rifles. It featured a ten-round box magazine which was loaded with the .303 British cartridge manually from the top, either one round at a time or by means of five-round chargers. The Lee–Enfield was the standard issue weapon to rifle companies of the British Army and other Commonwealth nations in both the First and Second World Wars (these Commonwealth nations included Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa, among others). Although officially replaced in the UK with the L1A1 SLR in 1957, it remained in widespread British service until the early/mid-1960s and the 7.62 mm L42 sniper variant remained in service until the 1990s. As a standard-issue infantry rifle, it is still found in service in the armed forces of some Commonwealth nations, notably with the Bangladesh Police, which makes it the longest-serving military bolt-action rifle still in official service. The Canadian Forces' Rangers Arctic reserve unit still used Enfield No.4 rifles as of 2012, with plans announced to replace the weapons sometime in 2014 or 2015. Total production of all Lee–Enfields is estimated at over 17 million rifles.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105501;New Submachinegun Design: The Sten Submachinegun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105501;The STEN (or Sten gun) was a family of British submachine guns chambered in 9×19mm and used extensively by British and Commonwealth forces throughout World War II and the Korean War. They were notable for having a simple design and very low production cost making them effective insurgency weapons for resistance groups.  STEN is an acronym, from the names of the weapon's chief designers, Major Reginald V. Shepherd and Harold Turpin, and EN for Enfield. Over 4 million Stens in various versions were made in the 1940s.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105502;New Submachinegun Design: The Lanchester Submachinegun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105502;The Lanchester is a submachine gun (SMG) manufactured by the Sterling Armaments Company between 1941 and 1945. It is a copy of the German MP28/II and was manufactured in two versions, Mk.1 and Mk.1*, the latter was a simplified version of the original Mk.1, with no fire selector and simplified sights. It was primarily used by the British Royal Navy during the Second World War, and to a lesser extent by Royal Air Force regiments (for airfield protection). It was given the general designation of Lanchester after George Herbert Lanchester who was charged with producing the weapon at the Sterling Armaments Company.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105503;New Submachinegun Design: The Sterling Submachinegun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105503;The Sterling submachine gun is a British submachine gun. It was trialled with the British Army in 1944–1945 as a replacement for the Sten, but it did not start to replace it until 1953. It remained in use until 1994, when it was phased out with the introduction of the L85A1 assault rifle.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105504;New Light Machine Gun Design: The Bren Light Machine Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105504;The Bren Gun, usually called simply the Bren, was a series of light machine guns adopted by Britain in the 1930s and used in various roles until 1992. While best known for its role as the British and Commonwealth forces' primary infantry light machine gun (LMG) in World War II, it was also used in the Korean War and saw service throughout the latter half of the 20th century, including the 1982 Falklands War. Although fitted with a bipod, it could also be mounted on a tripod or vehicle-mounted.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105505;New Light Machine Gun Design: The Vickers Berthier Light Machine Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105505;The Vickers–Berthier (VB) light machine gun manufactured by Vickers-Armstrong was based on a French design of just before World War I intended for use on aircraft. In 1925 Vickers in Britain purchased licence rights for production in their Crayford factory, and as a replacement for the Lewis Gun. It was an alternative to the water-cooled Vickers machine gun of same manufacture. The weapon used a similar gas and tipping bolt mechanism to the Bren gun, and also had a removable barrel, and was air-cooled like the Bren. It was adopted by the Indian Army in 1933.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105506;New Heavy Machine Gun Design: The Vickers Heavy Machine Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105506;The Vickers machine gun or Vickers gun is a name primarily used to refer to the water-cooled .303 British (7.7 mm) machine gun produced by Vickers Limited, originally for the British Army. The machine gun typically required a six to eight-man team to operate: one fired, one fed the ammunition, the rest helped to carry the weapon, its ammunition and spare parts. It was in service from before the First World War until the 1960s, with air-cooled versions of it on many Allied World War I fighter aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105507;New Mortar Design: The Stokes 3inch. Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105507;The Stokes mortar was a British trench mortar invented by Sir Wilfred Stokes KBE that was issued to the British, Commonwealth and U.S. armies, as well as the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps (CEP), during the later half of the First World War. The 3-inch trench mortar is a smooth-bore, muzzle-loading weapon for high angles of fire. Although it is called a 3-inch mortar, its bore is actually 3.2 inches or 81mm.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105508;New Mortar Design: The Ordnance ML 3inch. Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105508;The Ordnance ML 3-inch mortar was the United Kingdom's standard mortar used by the British Army from the early 1930s to the late 1960s, superseding the Stokes mortar Although called the '3-inch mortar' by the British Army, its calibre was actually 3.209 in (81.5 mm).;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105509;New Mortar Design: The Ordnance ML 2inch. Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105509;The Ordnance SBML 2-inch mortar, or more commonly just "2-inch mortar", was a British mortar issued to the British Army and the Commonwealth armies that saw use during the Second World War and later.  It had the advantages of being more portable than larger mortars which needed vehicles for them to be carried around, but the '2-inch' gave greater range and firepower than rifle grenades.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105510;New Mortar Design: The Ordnance ML 4.2inch. Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105510;The 4.2 inch mortar was a Smooth Bore (SB) weapon of the Stokes pattern and was designed by the Armaments Research and Development Establishment and produced by the Royal Ordnance Factories. It entered British service in 1942, where it was used to equip Royal Engineer chemical warfare companies. The Mark 3 became the standard model. The first combat use was at El Alamein, which expended all the HE ammunition in the theatre.  Around mid 1943, the RE chemical warfare companies were disbanded and one heavy mortar company of each Infantry Division's machine gun battalion was equipped with the mortar. This company was organized with sixteen 4.2-in mortars, divided into four Platoons of four mortars each.  In early 1944, Divisions in Italy also held a pool of mortars for issue to other units as required, usually troops in the divisional anti-tank regiment - some regiments even converted one or more batteries to mortars.  The mortars were somewhat slower in reaching the far east, although the Australian forces in the South West Pacific had them before troops fighting in Burma did.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105511;New Anti-Tank Rifle Design: The Boys Anti-Tank Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105511;The Rifle, Anti-Tank, .55in, Boys commonly known as the "Boys Anti-tank Rifle" (or incorrectly "Boyes"), was a British anti-tank rifle in use during World War II. It was often nicknamed the "elephant gun" by its users due to its size and large bore.  There were three main versions of the Boys, an early model (Mark I) which had a circular muzzle brake and T-shaped monopod, built primarily at BSA in England, a later model (Mk I*) built primarily at Jonathan Inglis in Toronto, Canada, that had a square muzzle brake and a V shaped bipod, and a third model made for airborne forces with a 30-inch (762 mm) barrel and no muzzle brake. There were also different cartridges, with a later version offering better penetration.  Although adequate against light tanks in the early part of the war, the Boys was ineffective against heavier armour and was phased out in favour of the PIAT mid-war.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105564;New Projector Anti-Tank Design: The PIAT;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105564;The Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank (PIAT) was a British man-portable anti-tank weapon developed during the Second World War. The PIAT was designed in 1942 in response to the British Army's need for a more effective infantry anti-tank weapon, and entered service in 1943.  The PIAT was based on the spigot mortar system, that launched a 2.5 pound (1.1 kg) bomb using a powerful spring and a cartridge in the tail of the projectile. It possessed an effective range of approximately 115 yards (110 m) in a direct fire anti-tank role, and 350 yards (320 m) in an indirect fire 'house-breaking' role. The PIAT had several advantages over other infantry anti-tank weapons of the period, which included a lack of muzzle smoke to reveal the position of the user, and an inexpensive barrel; however, this was countered by, amongst other things, a difficulty in cocking the weapon, the bruising the user received when firing it, and problems with ammunition reliability.  The PIAT was first used during the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, and remained in use with British and Commonwealth forces until the early 1950s. PIATs were supplied to or obtained by other nations and forces, including the Soviet Union (through Lend Lease), the French resistance, the Polish Underground, and the Israeli Haganah (which used PIATs during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War). Six members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces received Victoria Crosses for their use of the PIAT in combat.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105512;New Infantry Gun Design Design: The QF 3.7in. Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105512;The 3.7-inch howitzer was first introduced in 1917, and was used in action in that year in the Mesopotamian Campaign (modern Iraq area).  The 22nd (Derajat) Indian Frontier Force mountain battery arrived in the East Africa campaign on 18 December 1916, when they relieved the 28th Battery which returned to India. They appear to have re-equipped from the 10 pounder mountain gun to the 3.7-inch howitzer while in East Africa, and first used the new weapon in action in an attack on German positions at Medo, 11 April 1918.  During World War II, the weapon equipped artillery units engaged in the North African Campaign (Tunisia), the Italian Campaign, the Kokoda Campaign, and Burma Campaign, and it was also used in the Netherlands and Ruhr fighting in 1944-45 by units originally destined for mountain warfare in Greece. In the latter theatre, on occasion the gun was dismantled and man-hauled up to the upper floors of buildings to provide close support in urban fighting. A lightened version was used briefly by Airborne formations. Several were supplied to the French Army after 1945; one is on display at the Vietnam Army Museum in Hanoi while another is displayed at the Zone 5 Military Museum, Danang.  During the war the gun, and its ammunition, were also manufactured in other Commonwealth Countries, including South Africa, by the ISCOR (The Iron and Steel Corporation of South Africa), and India. South Africa also produced modified versions of the gun.  The gun was finally declared obsolete by the British Army in 1960, although it had not seen service since 1945.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105513;New Infantry Gun Design Design: The QF 6pdr. Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105513;The British Army used the QF 6pdr. Gun not only as an anti-tank weapon but also used high explosive charges making it an effective short range infantry gun.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105514;New Howitzer Design: The QF 95mm Howtizer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105514;The Ordnance QF 95-mm howitzer was a British howitzer built in two versions during the Second World War. The tank howitzer version was accepted for service use, but an infantry howitzer version was not accepted for service use.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105515;New Howitzer Design: The 6inch. CWT Medium Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105515;The Ordnance BL 6 inch 26cwt howitzer was a British howitzer used during World War I and World War II. The qualifier "26cwt" refers to the weight of the barrel and breech together which weighed 26 long hundredweight.  During the interwar period the carriage had its wooden spoked wheels replaced with modern steel wheels and pneumatic tyres. During World War II, its use was restricted after 1942 when the replacement BL 5.5 inch Medium Gun came into use. It was however reintroduced in Burma due to a number of premature detonations in 5.5-inch (140 mm) guns. It was declared obsolete with the end of the war in 1945.  Captured examples received the designation FH-412(e) in German use.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105516;New Artillery Gun Design: The Ordnance QF 18pdr Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105516;The Ordnance QF 18 pounder, or simply 18-pounder Gun, was the standard British Empire field gun of the World War I era. It formed the backbone of the Royal Field Artillery during the war, and was produced in large numbers. It was used by British and Empire Forces in all the main theatres, and by British troops in Russia in 1919. Its calibre (84 mm) and hence shell weight were greater than those of the equivalent field guns in French (75 mm) and German (77 mm) service. It was generally horse drawn until mechanisation in the 1930s.  The first versions were introduced in 1904 and later versions remained in service with British forces until early 1942. During the interwar period the 18-pounder formed the basis of early versions of the equally famous Ordnance QF 25 pounder, which would form the basis of the British artillery forces during and after World War II, in much the same fashion as the 18-pounder had during World War I.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105517;New Artillery Gun Design: The Ordnance QF 25pdr Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105517;The Ordnance QF 25-pounder, or more simply 25-pounder or 25-pdr, was the major British field gun and howitzer during World War II. It was introduced into service just before the war started, combining high-angle and direct-fire, relatively high rates of fire, and a reasonably lethal shell in a highly mobile piece. It remained the British Army's primary artillery field piece well into the 1960s, with smaller numbers serving in training units until the 1980s. Many Commonwealth of Nations countries used theirs in active or reserve service until about the 1970s and ammunition for the weapon is currently being produced by Pakistan Ordnance Factories.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105518;New Medium Artillery Gun Design: The Ordnance BL 5.5in. Medium Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105518;The BL 5.5 inch Gun was a British artillery gun introduced during the middle of the Second World War to equip medium batteries.  In January 1939 a specification was issued for a gun to replace the 6 inch 26 cwt howitzers in use with most medium batteries. The first units were equipped in UK in the summer of 1941 and in North Africa a year later, 20 guns equipped British and Free French batteries at El Alamein. Subsequently it also equipped Canadian, Australian, South African, Polish and Indian regiments, and after the war, it was also used by New Zealand. In the Second World War the normal organisation was a regiment of 16 guns organised into two batteries.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105519;New Medium Howitzer Design: The Ordnance BL 4.5in. Medium Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105519;The Ordnance QF 4.5-inch howitzer was the standard British Empire field (or ‘light’) howitzer of the First World War era. It replaced the BL 5-inch howitzer and equipped some 25% of the field artillery. It entered service in 1910 and remained in service through the interwar period and was last used in the field by British forces in early 1942. It was generally horse drawn until mechanisation in the 1930s. It was used by British and Commonwealth forces in most theatres, by Russia and by British troops in Russia in 1919. Its calibre (114 mm) and hence shell weight were greater than those of the equivalent German field howitzer (105 mm); while France did not have an equivalent. In the Second World War it equipped some units of the BEF and British, Australian, New Zealand and South African batteries in East Africa and the Middle and Far East.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105520;New Medium Field Gun Design: The Ordnance BL 60Pdr Heavy Field Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105520;The Ordnance BL 60-pounder was a British 5 inch (127 mm) heavy field gun designed in 1903-05 to provide a new capability that had been partially met by the interim QF 4.7 inch Gun. It was designed for both horse draft and mechanical traction and served throughout the First World War in the main theatres. It remained in service with British and Commonwealth forces in the inter-war period and in frontline service with British and South African batteries until 1942 being superseded by the BL 4.5 inch Medium Gun.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105521;New Heavy Siege Howitzer Design: The Ordnance BL 12in. Heavy Siege Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105521;The Ordnance BL 12-inch howitzer was a scaled-up version of the successful BL 9.2-inch siege howitzer.  Following the success of their BL 9.2-inch howitzer, Vickers designed an almost identical version scaled up to a calibre of 12 inches, the Mk II entering service on the Western Front in August 1916. Eight complete equipments are reported as arriving in August 1916 and being in action in France shortly afterwards.  It was similar but unrelated to the BL 12 inch railway howitzers Mk I, III and V produced by the Elswick Ordnance Company at the same time.  The Mk IV was a more powerful version with longer barrel produced from 1917.  Later models were used for British home defence in World War II.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105522;New Heavy Howitzer Design: The Ordnance BL 8in. Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105522;The BL 8-inch howitzer Marks VI, VII and VIII were a series of British artillery siege howitzers on mobile carriages of a new design introduced in World War I. They were designed by Vickers in Britain and produced by all four British artillery manufacturers, but mainly by Armstrong, and one American company. They were the equivalents of the German 21 cm Morser 16 and in British service were used similarly to the BL 9.2-inch howitzer, but were quicker to manufacture, and more mobile. They delivered a 200 lb shell to 12,300 yards. They had limited service in the British Army in World War II before being converted to the new 7.2-inch calibre. They also equipped a small number of Australian and Canadian batteries in World War I and by the US Army in that war. They were used in small numbers by other European armies.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105523;New Heavy Howitzer Design: The Ordnance BL 7.2in. Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105523;The BL 7.2-inch howitzer Mks I–V and Mk 6, were a series of heavy artillery pieces used by the British Army throughout World War II.  In 1940 the British Army concluded that the only available heavy artillery, the World War I era BL 8-inch howitzer, had insufficient range for the conditions of WWII. As a stopgap the decision was made to re-line the existing barrels to a smaller calibre and develop a new range of ammunition to achieve the desired ranges.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105524;New Rocket Artillery Design: The 3in. Rocket, No.8 Mk 1;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105524;Mattress was the term applied to ground-based Western Allied multiple rocket launchers during World War II. Compared with the German and Soviet forays into this area (the Nebelwerfer and Katyusha launchers respectively) the western Allies developed and deployed these weapons late in the war. Nevertheless, they did see useful service as artillery support during the crossings of the Rhine and the Scheldt rivers.  The so-called land mattress was a ground-based weapon named after its naval equivalent. Based on the Z gun anti-aircraft rockets, it was tested in the summer of 1944 and saw some action with British and Canadian troops, with mixed results. The Land Mattress was based on the 3-inch-diameter (76 mm) tube of the RP-3 or "60lb" rocket used as an air-to-ground weapon with naval 5-inch shells as warheads, and consisted of a 16- or 30-tube launching system mounted on a towed carriage. The land version had an operational range of 8,000 yards (7.3 km). Rounds were fired at a rate of 4 per second. At the crossing of the Scheldt over a thousand rockets were fired in 6 hours.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105525;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The QF 2Pdr 40mm Anti-Tank Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105525;The Ordnance QF 2-pounder (or simply "2 pounder gun") was a 40 mm (1.575 in) British anti-tank and vehicle-mounted gun, employed in the Second World War. It was actively used in the Battle of France, and during the North Africa Campaign. As Axis tanks improved in armoured protection, it lost effectiveness, and it was gradually replaced by the 6-pounder, starting in 1942, though some remained in service until the end of the war. In its vehicle-mounted variant, the 2-pounder was also a common main gun on British tanks early in World War II, and was a typical main armament of armoured cars, such as the Daimler, throughout the war.  This QF 2-pounder was not the same gun as the QF 2 pounder "pom-pom" gun extensively used by the Royal Navy as an anti-aircraft gun; they shared only the projectile weight of 2 pounds (0.9 kg).;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105526;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The QF 6Pdr 57mm Anti-Tank Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105526;The Ordnance Quick-Firing 6-pounder 7 cwt, or just 6 pounder, was a British 57 mm gun, their primary anti-tank gun during the middle of World War II, as well as the main armament for a number of armoured fighting vehicles. It was first used in North Africa in April 1942, and quickly replaced the 2 pounder in the anti-tank role, allowing the 25 pounder to revert to its intended artillery role. The United States Army also adopted the 6 pdr as their primary anti-tank gun under the designation 57 mm Gun M1.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105527;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The QF 17Pdr 76.2mm Anti-Tank Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105527;The Ordnance Quick-Firing 17-pounder (or just 17-pdr) was a 76.2 mm (3 inch) gun developed by the United Kingdom during World War II. It was used as an anti-tank gun on its own carriage, as well as equipping a number of British tanks. It was the most effective Allied anti-tank gun of the war. Used with the APDS shot, it was capable of defeating all but the thickest armour on German tanks. It was used to 'up-gun' some foreign-built vehicles in British service, notably to produce the Sherman Firefly variant of the US M4 Sherman tank, giving British tank units the ability to hold their own against their German counterparts. In the anti-tank role, it was replaced after the war by the 120 mm BAT recoilless rifle. As a tank gun, it was succeeded by the 84 mm 20 pounder.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105528;New Anti-Air Gun Design: The QF 3in 20 CWT AA Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105528;The QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun became the standard anti-aircraft gun used in the home defence of the United Kingdom against German airships and bombers and on the Western Front in World War I. It was also common on British warships in World War I and submarines in World War II. 20 cwt referred to the weight of the barrel and breech, to differentiate it from other "3 inch" guns (1 cwt = 1 hundredweight = 112 lb, hence the barrel and breech together weighed 2250 lb). While other AA guns also had a bore of 3 inches, the term "3 inch" was only ever used to identify this gun in the World War I era, and hence this is what writers are usually referring to by "3 inch AA gun".;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105529;New Anti-Air Gun Design: The QF 3.7in AA;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105529;The QF 3.7-inch AA was Britain's primary heavy anti-aircraft gun during World War II. It was roughly the equivalent of the German 88 mm FlaK and American 90 mm, but with a slightly larger calibre of 94 mm. It was used throughout World War II in all theatres except the Eastern Front. The gun was produced in six major variants, two versions (mobile and fixed) and in considerable numbers. The Mk VI ordnance used only with a fixed mounting gave vastly increased performance. It remained in use after the war until AA guns were replaced by guided missiles, notably the Thunderbird, in the late 1950s.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105530;New Self-Propelled Artillery Gun Design: The T48 Gun Motor Carriage;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105530;The T48 Gun Motor Carriage was a self-propelled anti-tank gun produced by the Diamond T company in 1943 for the United States. The Americans and British mounted an artillery gun to the back of the T-48 to act as an ad-hoc self-propelled artillery gun until more focused designs could be produced.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105531;New Self-Propelled Artillery Gun Design: The Bishop SP Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105531;The Bishop was a British self-propelled artillery vehicle based on the Valentine tank. A result of a rushed attempt to create a self-propelled gun armed with the 25 Pounder gun-howitzer, the vehicle had numerous problems, was produced in limited numbers and was soon replaced by better designs.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105532;New Self-Propelled Artillery Gun Design: The Deacon SP Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105532;The AEC Mk I Gun Carrier, known as Deacon, was a British armoured fighting vehicle of the Second World War. It was an attempt to make the QF 6 pounder anti-tank gun into a self-propelled artillery piece. It was employed only during the North African Campaign from 1942–1943.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105533;New Self-Propelled Artillery Gun Design: The Sexton SP Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105533;The 25pdr SP, tracked, Sexton was a self-propelled artillery vehicle of World War II. It was based on Canadian-built versions of the American M3 Lee and M4 Sherman tank chassis, which entered production in Canada as the Ram and Grizzly. When Sherman production in the US expanded and supply was no longer a problem, in 1943 it was decided to switch the Canadian production lines to produce the Sexton to give the British Army a mobile artillery gun using their Ordnance QF 25 pounder gun-howitzer. It found use in the Canadian and British Army, as well as numerous other British Empire and associated forces. Just after the war, a number of Grizzly and Sextons were sold to Portugal, who used them into the 1980s.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105534;New Self-Propelled Artillery Gun Design: The Sexton II SP Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105534;Modification of the Grizzly tank, mounting the British 25-pounder field howitzer. Mass production was launched at the Montreal Locomotive Works in Canada, with 2,150 vehicles manufactured from 1943 through 1945.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105535;New Self-Propelled Anti-Air Gun Design: The 20mm Anti-Aircraft Portee;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105535;A portee is a truck that carries a gun on its bed, such that the gun is not fixed permanently to the vehicle, can be quickly unloaded and can be fired from the truck.  While the term portee can be used to denote any truck carrying a gun on its bed, it is most often used to describe equipments used by British/Commonwealth forces in the North African Campaign of World War II. Modern terms for such vehicle are technical and/or gun truck.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105536;New Self-Propelled Anti-Air Gun Design: The Crusader III, AA Mk.I;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105536;The 6-pounder was replaced with a Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft gun with an autoloader and powered mounting in an open-topped turret. The crew numbered four: gun commander, gun layer, loader, and driver. However, those Crusader III, AA Mk I used in NW Europe from D-day on did not have the turret, but a 40 mm Bofors gun mounted directly on the hull top with its standard shield.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105537;New Infantry Tank Design: The Matilda I;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105537;The Tank, Infantry, Mk I, Matilda I (A11) was a British infantry tank of the Second World War. It is not to be confused with the later model Tank, Infantry Mk II (A12), also known as the "Matilda II", which took over the "Matilda" name after the early part of the war, when the first Matilda was withdrawn from combat service. They were different designs and did not share components but did have some similar traits, because they were both designed to be infantry tanks, a type of tank that tended to sacrifice speed for increased armour protection.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105538;New Infantry Tank Design: The Matilda II;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105538;The Infantry Tank Mark II (sometimes referred to as Matilda II, Matilda senior, by General Staff Specification A12, Waltzing Matilda, or simply an 'I' tank) was a British infantry tank of the Second World War. It was the only British tank to serve from the start of the war to its end, although it is particularly associated with the North Africa Campaign. It was replaced in service by the Infantry Tank Mk III Valentine. With its heavy armour, the Matilda II was an excellent infantry support tank, but with somewhat limited speed and armament.  When the earlier Infantry Tank Mark I, which was also known as "Matilda", was removed from service by 1940, the Infantry Tank Mk II became known simply as the "Matilda".;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105539;New Infantry Tank Design: The Valentine Mk III;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105539;The Tank, Infantry, Mk III, Valentine was an infantry tank produced in the United Kingdom during the Second World War. More than 8,000 of the type were produced in eleven marks, plus various specialised variants, accounting for approximately a quarter of wartime British tank production. The many variants included riveted and welded construction, petrol and diesel powerplants and a progressive increase in armament. It was supplied in large numbers to the USSR and built under licence in Canada. Developed by Vickers, it proved to be both strong and reliable.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105540;New Infantry Tank Design: The Churchill;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105540;The Tank, Infantry, Mk IV (A22) was a British heavy infantry tank used in the Second World War, best known for its heavy armour, large longitudinal chassis with all-around tracks with multiple bogies, and its use as the basis of many specialist vehicles. It was one of the heaviest Allied tanks of the war.  The origins of the design lay in the expectation that war in Europe might be fought under similar conditions to those of the First World War, and emphasized the ability to cross difficult ground. The Churchill was rushed into production to build up British defences against a possible German invasion. The first vehicles had flaws that had to be overcome before the Churchill was accepted for wide use. After several Marks had been built a better armoured version, the Mark VII, entered service.  The Churchill was used by British and Commonwealth forces in North Africa, Italy and North-West Europe. In addition, a few hundred were supplied to the USSR and used on the Eastern Front.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105541;New Light Tank Design: The Vickers Light Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105541;The Tank, Light, Mk VI was the sixth in the line of light tanks built by Vickers-Armstrongs for the British Army during the interwar period. The company had achieved a degree of standardization with their previous five models, and the Mark VI was identical in all but a few respects. The turret, which had been expanded in the Mk V to allow a three-man crew to operate the tank, was further expanded to give room in its rear for a wireless set. The weight of the tank was increased to 10,800 pounds (4,900 kg), which although heavier than previous models actually improved its handling characteristics, and an 88 horsepower (66 kW) engine was added to the model to increase its maximum speed to 35 miles per hour (56 km/h). It had the Horstmann coil-spring suspension system which was found to be durable and reliable, although the fact that the tank was short in relation to its width and that it pitched violently on rough ground made accurate gunnery whilst moving exceptionally difficult. The Mk VI possessed a crew of three consisting of a driver, gunner and commander who also doubled as the radio operator, between 4 millimetres (0.16 in) and 14 millimetres (0.55 in) of armour, which could resist rifle and machine gun bullets, and its armament consisted of one water-cooled .303 inch and one .50 inch Vickers machine gun.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105542;New Light Tank Design: The Vickers Mk VII Tetrarch;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105542;The Light Tank Mk VII (A17), also known as the Tetrarch, was a British light tank produced by Vickers-Armstrongs in the late 1930s and deployed during the Second World War. The Tetrarch was originally designed as the latest in the line of light tanks built by the company for the British Army. It improved upon its predecessor, the Mk VIB Light Tank, by introducing the extra firepower of a 2-pounder gun. The War Office ordered 70 tanks, an order that eventually increased to 220. Production was delayed by several factors, and as a consequence, only 100 to 177 of the tanks were produced.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105543;New Light Tank Design: The Vickers Mk VIII Harry Hopkins;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105543;The Tank, Light, Mk VIII (A25), also known as the Harry Hopkins, after American President Roosevelt's chief diplomatic advisor, was a British light tank produced by Vickers-Armstrong during World War II. The Mk VIII was the latest in the line of light tanks the company had built for the British Army, and was intended to be the successor of the previous light tank designed by Vickers-Armstrong, the Mk VII Tetrarch. A number of changes were made to the Mk VIII, most notably increasing its width, length and weight and also increasing the thickness of the armour. The design of the tank was submitted to the War Office in late 1941, with an initial order for 1,000 models being made by the Tank Board of the War Office in the same month, a number that increased to 2,410 in November. Production began in June 1942 but immediately began encountering problems with the tank, and a number of modifications had to be made to the design after complaints were made by the War Office and the Fighting Vehicle Proving Establishment. These problems were so acute that only 6 tanks had been produced by mid-1943, and only 100 when production ended in February 1945.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105544;New Medium Tank Design: The Vickers Mediums;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105544;After the First World War Britain disbanded most of its tank units leaving only five tank battalions equipped with the Mark V and the Medium Mark C. At first a large budget was made available for tank design but this was all spent on the failed development of the Medium Mark D. When the government design bureau, the Tank Design Department, was closed in 1923 any direct official involvement in tank development was terminated. However private enterprise in the form of the Vickers-Armstrong company built two prototypes of a new tank in 1921.  In 1920 the Infantry had plans to acquire a Light Infantry Tank. Colonel Johnson of the Tank Design Department derived such a type from the Medium Mark D. In competition Vickers built the Vickers Light Tank.  The Vickers design still was reminiscent of the Great War types. It had a high, lozenge-shaped, track frame with side doors but it also showed some improvements. There was a fully revolving turret and the suspension was sprung by vertical helical springs, while the Medium Mark C still had a fixed turret and was unsprung. The Vickers was much smaller than the Medium C at just seven feet high and weighing only 8.5 short tons. It was driven by a separately compartmented 86 hp engine through an advanced hydraulic Williams-Jenney transmission, allowing infinitely variable turn cycles. The first prototype was a "Female" version with three Hotchkiss machine guns; the second prototype was a "Male" which had a 3-pounder gun in place of one of the machine guns and also a machine gun for anti-aircraft use. It looked far closer to a modern tank than its predecessors with the turret, the front of the fighting compartment and the hull front plate all strongly rounded. The advanced transmission proved to be utterly unreliable however and the project was abandoned in 1922 in favour of a generally more conventional design, the Vickers Light Tank Mark I. This would be renamed the Vickers Medium Tank Mark I in 1924 . The first prototypes were sent to Bovington for trial in 1923. The Vickers designation was A2E1.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105545;New Medium Tank Design: The Cruiser Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105545;The cruiser tank (also called cavalry tank or fast tank) was a British tank concept of the inter-war period. This concept was the driving force behind several tank designs which saw action during the Second World War. In British use, the cruiser formed part of a doctrine paired with the "infantry tank", a much slower but better armoured design intended to work in concert with the infantry in punching holes through enemy lines for the cruisers to exploit.  During early World War II, the Crusader was probably the best-known cruiser, it was first used in mid 1941 and thereafter used in large numbers in the Western Desert Campaign. The contemporary Covenanter was unreliable and was retained in the UK for training use.  The Cavalier, Centaur and Cromwell came out of the planned successor to the Covenanter and Crusader. Intended to be in production by 1942, the project was delayed and the Crusader was upgunned as an interim measure with the Mk.III 6 pounder gun. Cavalier was a development of Crusader. Centaur and Cromwell were an alternative design using the same engine as the Cavalier and the new Rolls-Royce Meteor engine respectively.  The Centaur and Cromwell saw action from the Invasion of Normandy onwards. The Comet was a development of the Cromwell using a modified 17 pounder gun and was fielded in the beginning of 1945. By this point in the war, the firepower and armour protection of the cruisers made them indistinguishable from medium tanks.  In the course of the war, technological improvements enabled heavier tanks to approximate the speed of the cruisers and the concept became obsolete. The last of their line was the Centurion. The Centurion was designed to satisfy the "Heavy Cruiser" criterion by combining the mobility of a cruiser tank and armour of an Infantry tank in one chassis. This idea - and the Centurion along with it - then evolved into the "Universal tank" concept, a design that could "do it all". Ultimately, the Centurion tank transcended its cruiser tank origins and become Britain's first modern main battle tank.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105546;New Heavy Tank Design: The Black Prince Mk I Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105546;Tank, Infantry, Black Prince (A43) is the name that was assigned to an experimental development of the Churchill tank with a larger, wider hull and a QF 17-pounder (76 mm) gun. It was named after Edward, the Black Prince, a famous 14th century military leader.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105547;New Heavy Tank Design: The Centurion Mk.I Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105547;The Centurion, introduced in 1945, was the primary British main battle tank of the post-World War II period. It is widely considered to be one of the most successful post-war tank designs, remaining in production into the 1960s, and seeing combat in the front lines into the 1980s. The chassis was also adapted for several other roles, and these have remained in service to this day.  Development of the tank began in 1943 and manufacture of the Centurion began in January 1945, six prototypes arriving in Belgium less than a month after the war in Europe ended in May 1945. It first entered combat with the British Army in the Korean War in 1950, in support of the UN forces. The Centurion later served in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, where it fought against US-supplied M47 and M48 Patton tanks and it served with the Royal Australian Armoured Corps in Vietnam.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105548;New Light Tank Destroyer Design: The Universal Carrier 2pdr;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105548;The Universal Carrier was developed during the interwar period and was the main armored personnel carrier used by British Commonwealth forces. A total of 90,000 vehicles were produced from 1937 through 1945. Versions of the Universal Carriers were used for transporting personnel and equipment, as machine gun platforms, and for reconnaissance purposes. In 1940, a variant with a 40-mm anti-tank gun was developed.  The UC 2-pdr has the best top speed among the 2 Tank Destroyers (along with the T18), making it easy to relocate and find cover quickly. Like all British low-tier tanks, it suffers from poor armor which refuses to bounce shots from even the weakest weapons in the game. Staying hidden is essential. The 6-pdr gun is quite powerful and can two-shot many Tier 2s, though it has lower penetration than the stock gun. The UC 2-pdr has no trouble penetrating Tier 2 enemies and only the toughest Tier 3s can withstand its gun. It also has fairly good view range which allows it to spot for itself and teammates. The very wide gun arc allows the UC 2-pdr to fire without needing to move its hull which makes it even harder to detect.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105549;New Medium Tank Destroyer Design: The Challenger;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105549;The Tank, Cruiser, Challenger (A30) was a British tank of World War II. It mounted the QF 17-pounder anti-tank gun on a chassis derived from the Cromwell tank to add heavier anti-tank firepower to the cruiser tank units.  The design compromises made in fitting the large gun onto the Cromwell chassis resulted in a tank with a powerful weapon, but with less armour. The extemporised Sherman Firefly conversion of the US-supplied Sherman was easier to produce and, combined with delays in production, meant that only 200 Challengers were built. However, it was able to keep up with the fast Cromwell tank and was used alongside them.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105550;New Medium Tank Destroyer Design: The Archer QF 6pdr Mk IV;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105550;This powerful, lightly-armored tank destroyer was capable of engaging enemy tanks of any type at distances up to 1,000 meters. Top speed was relatively low because of the underpowered engine and weak suspension. Nonetheless, the Archer was a successful reuse of the outdated Valentine chassis. A total of 665 vehicles were built from 1943 through 1945.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105551;New Medium Tank Destroyer Design: The Archer QF 17pdr Mk II;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105551;The 17 pounder anti-tank gun was a very powerful gun but also very large, heavy, and could only be moved about the battlefield by a vehicle, which made the gun more effective in defence than in the attack. A version of the Churchill tank had been tested as a self-propelled gun; the "3-inch Gun Carrier" and the US was expected to be able to provide the M10 Wolverine through Lend-lease. Other projects were considered using obsolete tank chassis. Possible vehicles included the Valentine, for its reliability and low profile, and the Crusader, for its good power-to-weight ratio. In development were tank designs using the 17-pdr, which led to the Cruiser Mark VIII Challenger tank (and its post-war variant the Avenger), derived from the Cromwell cruiser tank, and the Sherman Firefly conversion of the Sherman tank.  The Valentine chassis was soon chosen, as it was in production but obsolescent as a tank in British use, and was also one of the few chassis that could accommodate such a large gun.  The engine in the Archer had a higher power rating than in the Valentine. Since the Valentine had a small hull and it was not possible to use a turret, the gun was mounted in a simple, low, open-topped armoured box, very much like the early Panzerjäger German self-propelled guns in appearance, with the gun facing to the rear, which kept the length of the Archer short. The mounting allowed for 11 degrees of traverse to either side, with elevation from -7.5 to +15 degrees.  On firing, the gun breech recoiled into the driver's space, with the driver staying in position, in case the vehicle needed to move quickly. The rear mounting combined with its low silhouette made the Archer an excellent ambush weapon, allowing its crew to fire, then drive away without turning round.  The first prototype was completed in 1943, with firing trials carried out in April 1943. Vickers were given orders for 800 vehicles.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105552;New Heavy Tank Destroyer Design: The AT-2 Heavy Tank Destroyer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105552;Design for an assault tank to break through enemy defensive lines. The design was completed by May 15th, 1943. No prototypes were built, the project helped set the stage for another heavy assault tank, the A39 Tortoise.  The AT 2 is radically different from its predecessors, it's the first true British Tank Destroyer in its line. The AT 2 is very slow, boasts tough all-round armor, and has an increased hitpoint pool. The AT 2, unlike tank destroyers of other nations, is a front-line tank. It is most effective leading the team while drawing and deflecting enemy fire, albeit while moving slowly. The AT 2 is a spearhead breakthrough tank but absolutely requires supporting teammates; it has very poor viewrange and is extremely vulnerable to flanking. A flanked AT 2 should keep its armor towards the enemies in front, it must rely on its teammates to deal with the flank because its turning speed is just too slow.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105553;New Heavy Tank Destroyer Design: The A-39 Tortoise;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105553;The Tank, Heavy Assault, Tortoise (A39) was a British heavy assault tank design developed in World War II but never put into mass production. It was developed for the task of clearing heavily fortified areas and as a result favoured armour protection over mobility.  Although heavy, at 78 tons, and not readily transported, it was considered reliable and a good gun platform. Only a few prototypes of the Tortoise had been produced by the end of the war.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105554;New Main Battle Tank Design: The Centurion Mk.II;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105554;The Centurion, introduced in 1945, was the primary British main battle tank of the post-World War II period. It is widely considered to be one of the most successful post-war tank designs, remaining in production into the 1960s, and seeing combat in the front lines into the 1980s.

The Centurion later served in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, where it fought against US-supplied M47 and M48 Patton tanks and it served with the Royal Australian Armoured Corps in Vietnam.  Between 1946 and 1962, 4,423 Centurions were produced, consisting of 13 basic marks and numerous variants. In British Army use it was replaced by the Chieftain.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105555;New Main Battle Tank Design: The Conqueror;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105555;The FV 214 Conqueror, also known as "Tank, Heavy No. 1, 120 mm Gun, Conqueror" was a British heavy tank of the post-war era. It was developed as a response to the Soviet Joseph Stalin IS-3 heavy tanks; its 120 mm gun was larger than the 20-pounder (83.4 mm) gun carried by its peer, the Centurion. The Conqueror's role was to provide long range anti-tank support for the Centurion. Conquerors were issued at nine for each regiment in Germany, usually grouped in three tank troops.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105556;New Main Battle Tank Design: The Vickers MBT;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105556;The Vickers MBT is a series of main battle tanks (MBTs) developed as a private venture by Vickers-Armstrongs for export. The design makes use of proven components such as the L7 gun of the Centurion, and the Leyland L60 multi-fuel engine, transmission and fire control system of the Chieftain. A large number of tanks were also built by India under licence as the Vijayanta.  The Vickers MBT followed on from a 24-tonne 20-pdr gunned tank design intended for export. This would be as well equipped as Centurion but substantially cheaper and with Vickers Vigilant missiles as effective. However with the appearance of the 105 mm L7 gun into the British, US and German tank designs, this light tank would have been less powerful while too large for the reconnaissance role, and so a new design was required. With armour twice that of the light tank design, it would still be 12 tonnes lighter than Centurion and hence more mobile. The design would use the new engine and transmission of the Chieftain tank then being developed. The development coincided with an agreement with India in 1961 to produce a tank design and help set up a factory there to produce it.  The Vickers MBT Mk 1 was designed to be a simple, low-cost, but effective tank. The first prototype was completed in 1963.  In 1964 one of the prototypes was sent to India.  The Vickers was made of welded rolled homogeneous armour plates. It weighed 38,600 kg, carried a 105mm gun with 44 rounds and had a top speed of 48 km/h. 70 tanks were sold to Kuwait and a large number of a modified version were made in India where the tank was called Vijayanta.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105557;New Main Battle Tank Design: The Chieftain;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105557;The Chieftain FV4201 was the main battle tank of the United Kingdom during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. A development of the Centurion and therefore a continuation of the British cruiser series, sharing a substantial commonality of parts with both its predecessor and successor. It was the "most formidable main battle tank in the world" with, at the time of its introduction in 1966 the most powerful main gun and most effective armour of any tank ever made. The Chieftain also introduced a supine (reclining backwards) driver position, enabling a heavily sloped hull with reduced height. Faster than Centurion, able to maintain its speed longer than the Leopard 1 and out-gunning its contemporaries Chieftain was also the first tank to enhance its (already superior) armour with composite armour add-ons, beginning with Chobham developed in the UK.  It remained in service until replaced by the Challenger 1.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105558;New Recoilless Rifle Design: The Ordnance 3.45in. Recoilless Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105558;The 3.45 inch RCL was an 88mm British recoilless weapon, designed by Sir Dennis Burney during the Second World War. Delayed by problems due to breech wear because of gas erosion upon firing, it did not see action, as was hoped, in the Far East, particularly Burma. However it did lead to the post war Mobat and Wombat recoilless rifles.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105559;New Advanced Assault Rifle Design: The Enfield L1A1 SLR;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105559;The L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle, also known as the SLR, by the Canadian Army designation C1A1 (C1) or in the USA as the "inch pattern" FAL, is a British Commonwealth derivative of the Belgian FN FAL battle rifle, produced under licence. It has seen use in the Australian Army, Canadian Army, Indian Army, Jamaica Defence Force, Malaysian Army, New Zealand Army, Rhodesian Army, and the British Army.  The original FAL was designed in Belgium using metric dimensions, while the components of the "inch-pattern" FALs are manufactured to a slightly modified design using British imperial units. Many sub-assemblies are interchangeable between the two types, while components of those sub-assemblies may not be compatible. Notable incompatibilities include the magazines and the butt-stock, which attach in different ways.  Most Commonwealth pattern FALs are semi-automatic only. A variant named L2A1/C2A1 (C2), meant to serve as a light machine gun in a support role, is also capable of automatic fire. Differences from the L1A1/C1 include a heavy barrel, squared front sight (versus the "V" on the semi-automatic models), a handguard that doubles as a foldable bipod, and a larger 30-round magazine although it could also use the normal 20-round magazines as well. Only Australia and Canada used this variant, as the UK and New Zealand used Bren light machine guns converted to fire the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge. Some Canadian C1s issued to naval personnel were also capable of automatic fire.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105560;New Advanced Light Machine Gun Design: The Enfield L4 BREN;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105560;A conversion of the Bren to 7.62mm NATO from 1958. Indian Army variants may be new-build, not conversions. L4 Brens can easily be identified by their different magazine. The British-issue L4 magazine is of 30-round capacity and has a slight curve. The L4 magazine was interchangeable with the L1A1 SLR magazine, so the L4 Bren also can be seen fitted with straight 20-round magazines from the SLR or with the straight 30-round magazine from the Australian L2A1 or Canadian C2A1 heavy-barrel SLR. The flash suppressor was changed from the cone type of .303 variants to a slotted type similar in appearance to that used on the SLR and L7 GPMG. All L4s are chambered for 7.62×51mm NATO rimless ammunition.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105561;New Advanced Light Machine Gun Design: The Enfield L7 GPMG;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105561;The L7 general-purpose machine gun is used by the British Army. The L7 and the related L8 are license-built derivatives of the MAG. The official British Army designation for the current version is the L7A2 GPMG (General Purpose Machine Gun). The L7 was adopted by the British forces as a replacement for the long-serving Vickers machine gun (in the medium role) and the Bren (in the light assault role), following trials in 1957. Built under license originally by Royal Small Arms Factory, Enfield Lock and currently by Manroy Engineering, it serves in the British Army, the Royal Marines and other services. There have been two main variants, the L7A1 and L7A2, developed for infantry use, with the L7A2 having superseded the earlier variant. Several other variants have been developed, notably the L8 (produced in the L8A1 and L8A2 versions), modified for mounting inside armoured vehicles (the L37 variant was developed for mounting on armoured vehicles). Although intended to replace the Bren entirely, that light machine gun (re-titled as the L4) continued in use in jungle terrain (especially in the Far East), where there was no requirement for the medium machine gun role, and with secondary units, until the adoption of the L86A1 Light Support Weapon (LSW). The LSW was intended to replace both the L7 and the L4 in the light machine gun role, but dissatisfaction with the L86's sustained fire capabilities and reliability resulted in combat units continuing to utilize the L7 whenever possible (although neither it, nor its 7.62×51 mm NATO ammunition were supposed to be issued to infantry platoons). The British Army and Royal Marines have since been issued with the L110A2 (FN Minimi Para) to replace the LSW as the light section support or fire support weapon. This uses the same NATO-standard 5.56×45mm ammunition as the L85 assault rifle. However, 7.62 mm L7 variants continue to be used in both dismounted roles and mounted on some British military vehicles, naval vessels, and aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105562;New Recoilless Rifle Design: The L6 WOMBAT AT;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105562;The L6 WOMBAT, (Weapon Of Magnesium, Battalion, Anti-Tank) was a 120 mm calibre recoilless anti-tank rifle used by the British Army. It is a lightweight model of the BAT for use by mobile units such as paratroopers or marines, referring to the use of magnesium alloys to reduce weight. They were used until anti-tank guided missiles, such as Vigilant and MILAN, took their place. However, WOMBAT was maintained in British Army anti-tank platoons in Berlin to supplement MILAN until the late 1980s, due to the expected engagement ranges should the Warsaw Pact have ever attacked. The wire guidance of MILAN would also have been problematic in the built up areas of Berlin. It was envisioned that WOMBAT would be used in 'shoot and scoot' attacks mounted on the back of stripped down Land Rover vehicles.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105563;New Advanced Mortar Design: The Ordnance L16 81mm Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105563;The United Kingdom's L16 81 mm mortar is the standard mortar used by the British armed forces. It originated as a joint design by UK and Canada. The version produced and used by Australia is named the F2 81mm Mortar, whilst the version used by the U.S. armed forces is known as the M252.  It was introduced in 1965/6, replacing the Ordnance ML 3 inch Mortar in UK service, where it is used by the Army, the Royal Marines and the RAF Regiment.  In UK armoured/mechanised infantry battalions, the L16 mortar is mounted in an FV 432 AFV (six per battalion mortar platoon). British army light role infantry battalions and the Royal Marines may transport their mortars in BvS 10 vehicles (the replacement for the Bv 206). Otherwise, it is carried dissassembled in three loads, (barrel, baseplate and bipod with sights, each approximately 11 kg), normally carried by a vehicle or helicopter and assembled for firing from the ground.  The weapon can be man-packed by the mortar detachment, but this is an arduous task (especially for the carrier of the bipod) and is preferably avoided. The ammunition in this case would be carried by other soldiers of the battalion. In addition to his normal equipment, each man would carry four bombs in a pair of two-bomb, plastic containers (known as greenies in the British Army).;;;;;;;;;;x
