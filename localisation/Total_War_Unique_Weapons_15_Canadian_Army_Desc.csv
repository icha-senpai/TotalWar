EVTNAME9107000;New Bolt-Action Rifle Design: The Ross Straight-Pull Service Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9107000;The Ross rifle was a straight-pull bolt action .303 inch-calibre rifle produced in Canada from 1903 until 1918. The Ross Mk.II (or "model 1905") rifle was highly successful in target shooting before WWI, but the close chamber tolerances, lack of primary extraction and overall length made the Mk.III (or "1910") Ross rifle unsuitable for the conditions of trench warfare and the often poor quality ammunition issued.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9107001;New Medium Tank Design: The Cruiser Tank Ram Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9107001;The Tank, Cruiser, Ram was a cruiser tank designed and built by Canada in the Second World War, based on the U.S. M3 Medium tank. Due to standardization on the American Sherman tank for frontline units, it was used exclusively for training purposes and was never used in combat as a gun tank. The chassis was used for several other combat roles however, such as a flamethrower tank, observation post, and armoured personnel carrier.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9107002;New Medium Tank Design: The Grizzly I Cruiser Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9107002;The Grizzly I was a Canadian-built M4A1 Sherman tank with some modifications, it had thicker, more sloping armour, had a longer range, and, most notably was fitted with Canadian Dry Pin (CDP) tracks, which did not require rubber, a scarce wartime material.;;;;;;;;;;x
