EVTNAME9105030;New Rifle Design: The Mosin Nagant;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105030;The Mosin–Nagant is a 5 shot, bolt-action, internal magazine-fed, military rifle, developed by the Imperial Russian Army in 1882–91, and used by the armed forces of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and various other nations. It is one of the most mass-produced military bolt-action rifles in history with over 37 million units produced since its inception in 1891.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105031;New Semi-Automatic Rifle Design: The AVS36;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105031;The AVS-36 was a Soviet automatic rifle which saw service in the early years of World War II. It was among the early selective fire infantry rifles (capable of both single and full-automatic fire) formally adopted for military service.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105032;New Semi-Automatic Rifle Design: The Tokarev SVT-38;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105032;The SVT-38 is a gas-operated rifle with a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston above the barrel and a tilting bolt.  The SVT-38 was equipped with a bayonet and a 10-round detachable magazine. The receiver was open-top, which enabled reloading of the magazine using five round Mosin–Nagant stripper clips. Fairly advanced features for the time were the adjustable gas system, muzzle brake, and telescopic sight rails milled into the receiver. The sniper variant had an additional locking notch for a see-through scope mount and was equipped with a 3.5X PU telescopic sight. This instrument was slightly shorter than the otherwise similar PU scope used on the Mosin–Nagant M1891/30 sniper rifle.   The initial reaction of the troops to this new rifle was negative. Among the issues were that the rifle was too long and cumbersome, difficult to maintain, and the magazine had a tendency to fall out of the rifle.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105033;New Semi-Automatic Rifle Design: The Tokarev SVT-40;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105033;The SVT-40 is a Soviet semi-automatic battle rifle, built upon the design of the SVT-38. The SVT-40 saw widespread service during and after World War II. Intended to be the new service rifle of the Soviet Red Army, production was disrupted by the German invasion in 1941 resulting in a change back to the older Mosin–Nagant bolt-action rifle for the duration of WWII.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105034;New Semi-Automatic Rifle Design: The Simonov SKS;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105034;The SKS is a Soviet semi-automatic carbine chambered for the 7.62×39mm round, designed in 1943 by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov. Its complete designation, SKS-45, is an initialism for Samozaryadnyj Karabin Sistemy Simonova, 1945.  The SKS has a conventional layout, with a wooden stock and rifle grip. The SKS is a gas-operated rifle that has a spring-loaded bolt carrier and a gas piston rod that work the action via gas pressure pushing against them. Also, it has a "tilting bolt" action locking system. The SKS is shorter and less powerful than the semi-automatic rifles that preceded it, such as the Soviet SVT-40. However, the SKS has a 4-inch longer barrel than AK-series rifles, which replaced it, as a result, it has a slightly higher muzzle velocity.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105035;New Submachinegun Design: The Degtyaryov PPD;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105035;Developed in the Soviet Union by arms designer Vasily Degtyaryov, it was a near direct copy of the German Bergmann MP 28. The PPD was designed to chamber the new Soviet 7.62×25mm Tokarev pistol cartridge, which was based on the similar 7.63×25mm Mauser cartridge used in the Mauser C96 pistol. The PPD utilized a large ammunition drum.  The PPD officially went into military service with the Red Army in 1935 as the PPD-34, although it was not produced in large quantities.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105036;New Submachinegun Design: The PPSh-41;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105036;The PPSh-41 is a Soviet submachine gun designed by Georgi Shpagin as a cheap, simplified alternative to the PPD-40.  The PPSh was a magazine-fed selective fire submachine gun using an open-bolt, blowback action. Made largely of stamped steel, it could be loaded with either a box or drum magazine, and fired the 7.62×25mm Tokarev pistol round.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105037;New Submachinegun Design: The PPSh-42;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105037;The PPSh-42 was an improvement upon the PPSh-41 where the main goals were the strengthening of the structure of the weapon.  It was successful design until the design of the PPSh-43 superceded it.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105038;New Submachinegun Design: The PPSh-43;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105038;Towards the middle of 1943 the modernized PPSh-43 entered production. Efforts were made to improve manufacturing and safety. The ventilated heat shield was integrated with the upper receiver cover, both the barrel and shoulder stock were shortened, the stock's locking mechanism was simplified, the casing ejector was moved to the rear of the recoil spring guide rod, the magazine well angle was increased in the receiver in order to enhance feeding reliability and the safety was improved to block the trigger and lock the bolt in either the open or closed positions.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105039;New Assault Rifle Design: The AK-47;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105039;Design work on the AK-47 began in the last year of World War II (1945). After the war in 1946, the AK-47 was presented for official military trials. In 1948, the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the Soviet Army. An early development of the design was the AKS (S—Skladnoy or "folding"), which was equipped with an underfolding metal shoulder stock. In 1949, the AK-47 was officially accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces and used by the majority of the member states of the Warsaw Pact.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105040;New LMG Design: The Degtyarev DP LMG (DP28);;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105040;The DP-28 was an improvement of the earlier DP-26, both designed by Vasily Degtyaryov. The DP-28 was relatively cheap and easy to manufacture – early models had fewer than 80 parts. The DP was especially able to withstand dirt in a reliable fashion. In tests it was buried in sand and mud and was still capable of firing more than 500 rounds. One of the DP's main drawbacks though was its bipod, it could not withstand much abuse and broke easily.  Furthermore, the recoil spring was located under the barrel, around the gas piston; this was one of the design problems of the DP, since the spring tended to lose its temper due to overheating.  Also, the only magazine option, a pan with 47 rounds that fed in from the top, was relatively small and continuous fire for long periods could not be relied on as much as contemporary belt-fed weapons. The ammunition was troublesome for automatic fire. Degtyarov had to use a flat pan magazine, which could feed those cartridges reliably, but was too heavy itself, uncomfortable to carry and prone to damage.  Due to the design of the magazine, reloading an empty magazine with cartridges took a very long time. A redeeming factor was that the DP's lower cyclic rate of fire did however reduce the risk of barrel overheating.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105041;New LMG Design: The Degtyarev DPM LMG;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105041;The DPM Light Machine Gun was a modernized version of the DP28 adopted in 1943–44, with a more robust bipod fastened to the cooling jacket and the recoil spring housed in a tube projecting from the rear of the receiver which necessitated a pistol grip for this model of the weapon.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105042;New LMG Design: The Degtyarev RP-46 LMG;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105042;The RP-46 was a metallic-belt fed version of the DP LMG adopted in 1946 with a heavier barrel to allow prolonged sustained fire. About 500 rounds could be fired continuously before the barrel had to be swapped or wait for it cool down. Also had a user-adjustable gas system, with three holes of varying diameters provided, to cope with varying environmental conditions and residue buildup. Although the empty weight of the RP-46 exceeded that of DP by 2.5 kg, when considered together with a single ammo box of 250 rounds, the RP-46 weighed 10 kg less than the DP together with the same amount of ammunition in DP pans.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105043;New HMG Design: The Maxim Model 1910 HMG;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105043;The Maxim M1910 was adopted in 1910 and was derived from Hiram Maxim's Maxim gun, chambered for the standard Russian 7.62×54mmR rifle cartridge. The M1910 was mounted on a wheeled mount with a gun shield and was replaced in Soviet service by the SG-43 Goryunov, which retained the wheeled and shielded carriage, starting in 1943. However, production of the Maxim did not end until 1945. In addition to the main infantry version, there were aircraft-mounted and naval variants.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105044;New HMG Design: The DShk 1938 HMG;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105044;The DShk 1938 is a Soviet heavy machine gun firing the 12.7×108mm cartridge. The weapon was also used as a heavy infantry machine gun, in which case it was frequently deployed with a two-wheeled mounting and a single-sheet armour-plate shield. It took its name from the weapons designers Vasily Degtyaryov, who designed the original weapon, and Georgi Shpagin, who improved the cartridge feed mechanism.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105045;New HMG Design: The Goryunov SG-43 HMG;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105045;The Goryunov MG proved a sound addition tot he Soviet arsenal when it was adopted in 1943 as a the SG-43.  It was lighter by about 20lbs, featured a variable rate-of-fire, and increased effective engagement ranges.  While intended to replace the aged Model 1910, factories could not keep up with the Army demand leaving both model types in service side-by-side for the duration of the war.  In practice, the SG-43 was as reliable as advertised, capable of 500-700 rounds per minute with a 2,624 feet-per-second muzzle velocity.  Effective ranges reached 1,100 meters with maximum engagement ranges out to 1,500 meters.  Feeding was by way of a 200- or 250-round belt and rangeing through a simple iron sigh arrangement.  In terms of excellence, the SG-43 rivaled the American Browning M1919 series as 'true' machine guns on World War 2 battlefields.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105046;New Mortar Design: The M1937 82mm Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105046;The M-37 or 82-BM-37 is a Soviet 82 millimeter calibre mortar designed by B.I. Szayrin and accepted into service in 1937. The design of the M-37 is based on the earlier French Brandt modele 27/31 mortar with Russian modifications.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105047;New Mortar Design: The M1938 50mm Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105047;The RM-38 was a Soviet 50 mm light infantry mortar, developed as a variant of the M1938 120mm mortar. The barrel was clamped at two elevation angles only - 45 and 75 degrees. Range variations were made by altering a sleeve round the base of the barrel. This sleeve opened a series of gas ports which bled off exhaust gases and so determined the range.  The project was deemed overly complex and expensive, and was only produced for a short time, before being replaced by the Model 1939. Despite the small number produced, some fell into German hands in 1941, who introduced them as the 5 cm Granatwerfer 205/1(r).;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105048;New Mortar Design: The M1938 120mm Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105048;The M1938 120mm mortar was a field mortar system accepted into service with the Red Army in 1939.  The weapon system was nothing more than a copy of the excellent French-designed Brandt series of 1935.  It weighted in at 620lbs when fully prepared to fire.  In action, the firepower inherent in a 120mm mortar system became wholly apparent and teh mortar was used in conjenction with infantry assaults as a support weapon. The mass amount of suppression and lethal firepower of a single high-explosive shell was something to note, particularly for the recieving German Army troops.  The Germans were so impressed with the caliber of power inherent in the Soviet M1938 that the weapon was outright copied to become the Granatwerfer 42 series mortar for the German Army in 1941.  The German version exceeded the Soviet design in range, reaching out to 6,600 yard over the original's 6,200 yard range.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105049;New Anti-Tank Rifle Design: The Degtyarev PTRD 1941 (PTRD-41);;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105049;It was a single-shot weapon which fired a 14.5mm x 114mm round. Although unable to penetrate the frontal armor of German tanks, it could penetrate the thinner sides of early-war German tanks as well as thinly armored self-propelled guns. The PTRD suffered from numerous flaws, the most notable are the lack of penetration versus enemy vehicles and inability to aim accurately with a telescopic sight, which frustrated PTRD teams, its size and weight which hampered its mobility and deployment, and its immense muzzle blast which gave away the unit's firing position. The PTRD was eventually replaced by the RPG series of anti-tank rocket launchers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105050;New Rocket Anti-Tank Design: The RPG-2;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105050;The chief attributes of the RPG-2 were robustness, simplicity, and low cost. However, its short range and inaccuracy led to its eventual replacement by the more effective RPG-7.  Derived partly from the experimental German Panzerfaust 250 and developed in 1947 and first issued to the Soviet Army in 1949, the RPG-2 was deployed at infantry squad level. Although the RPG-2 could be operated by one man, standard military practice called for a two-man crew: a grenadier carrying the launcher and a purpose-built backpack containing three grenades and an assistant armed with a rifle and carrying another three-grenade backpack.  The grenade for the RPG2 is known as the PG-2. When ignited by the percussion-type primer the charge burns at a very high rate projecting the grenade approximately 200 meters. The explosion of propellant occurs completely within the launching tube. The solid fuel booster (rocket engine) was not used until the development of the RPG-7 and placed into service as the PG-7 grenade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105051;New Infantry Gun Design: The F-22 76mm Divisional Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105051;The F-22 was a semi-universal gun which combined the capabilities of a divisional gun and - to some extent - of an anti-aircraft gun. It had a split-trail carriage with suspension and steel wheels with rubber tires. The gun was equipped with a semi-automatic vertical sliding breech block, the recoil mechanism consisted of a hydraulic recoil buffer and a hydropneumatic recuperator. The sights and the elevation controls were located on different sides of the barrel. The chamber fitted the standard model 1900 cartridge, which meant that the gun could use ammunition of older 76.2-mm divisional and regimental guns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105052;New Heavy Artillery Design: The Model 1937 152mm Heavy Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105052;Derived from a siege gun design from the French, the Model 1937 152mm Heavy Gun was a further derivation of the M1910 and the M1910/30.  The Soviet 152mm gun was a rather unremarkable, conventional artillery piece which fit perfectly with Soviet land battle doctrine of the time.  The Soviets rarely shied away from large field guns of any type and the Model 1937 was no exception.  Later after the war the gun had a Cold-War designation of ML-20.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105053;New Heavy Artillery Design: The Model 1931 203mm Heavy Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105053;The B-4 was a Heavy Howitzer that entered service in the Soviet Army in the early 1930's.  During the Second World War, it was under the command of the Stavka's strategic reserve. It was nicknamed "Stalin's sledgehammer" by German soldiers. These guns were used with success against heavy German fortifications and in urban combat for crushing protected buildings and bunkers. This weapon was used right up until the end of the war in the Battle of Berlin where the Red Army would bring these guns up at point blank range to smash German fortifications with their heavy 203mm shells.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105054;New Heavy Artillery Design: The Model 1943 152mm (D-1) Heavy Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105054;The D-1 was developed by the design bureau headed by F. F. Petrov in 1942 and 1943, based on the carriage of the 122 mm howitzer M1938 (M-30) and using the barrel of the 152 mm howitzer M1938 (M-10). The powerful and mobile D-1, with its wide range of ammunition, significantly increased the firepower and breakthrough abilities of Red Army tank and motor rifle formations. Several hundred D-1s were manufactured before the end of World War II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105055;New Medium Artillery Design: The M1944 100mm Field Gun (BS-3);;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105055;Originally designed as field gun and deployed to Light Artillery Brigades within the Red Army, the BS-3 was also successfully used as a powerful anti-tank gun. It was capable of defeating any contemporary tank at long range, excluding the Tiger Ausf B: to destroy that super-heavy tank the gun needs to shoot at less than 1600 meters from the target. The gun was also used as a field gun. Though in this role it was less powerful than the 122 mm A-19, as it fired a smaller round, the BS-3 was more mobile and had a higher rate of fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105056;New Medium Artillery Design: The M1931/37 122mm Field Gun (A-19);;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105056;The A-19 was a Soviet field gun developed in late 1930s by combining the barrel of the 122mm gun M1931 (A-19) and the carriage of the 152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20). The gun was in production from 1939 until 1946. It saw action in World War II (primarily with corps and RVGK artillery of the Red Army) and remained in service for a long time after the end of the war. Vehicle-mounted variants of the gun were fitted to the IS-2 and 3 tanks and ISU-122 self-propelled gun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105057;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The M1937 45mm Anti-Tank Gun (53-K);;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105057;The gun bearing factory designation 53-K was a combination of a modified carriage of the 37mm anti-tank gun model 1931 (built according to a documentation bought from Rheinmetall) with a 45mm barrel. The resulting light semi-automatic anti-tank gun was adopted for Red Army service in 1937, and thus known as "45 mm anti-tank gun M1937"  These guns were used in the first stage of the German-Soviet War, but their anti-armor capabilities allowed them to fight successfully only with German light tanks and armored personnel carriers. Early models of the Panzer III and Panzer IV could also be knocked out at close range, but this put Soviet artillerymen in greater danger. Due to these circumstances, model 1937 guns were replaced with the all-new design, the more powerful model 1942. The mass production of outdated model 1937 guns was stopped in 1943. The total number of guns produced was 37,354.  Two such guns were employed as an anti-tank platoons, organic to each rifle battalion. Additionally a dozen (12 guns) was in anti-tank battalions at a level of a rifle division. It was also used by separate anti-tank regiments (4-5 batteries of 4 guns each).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105058;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The M1942 45mm Anti-Tank Gun (M-42);;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105058;The M-42 was developed by the No. 172 Plant in Motovilikha as an upgrade of the 45 mm anti-tank gun M1937 (53-K). The gun received a longer barrel (L66, 20 calibers more than the previous one, so it was a 45 mm/L66), shells with more powerful cartridges, and a thicker shield (7 mm instead of 4.5 mm), but of hinged construction as a need for reduced profile, requiring the weapon to be serviced by crews while kneeling. Some minor changes were also introduced in order to speed up production.  These guns were used from 1942 until the end of World War II. In 1943, due to its insufficient anti-armor capabilities against new German tanks such as Tiger, Panther and Panzer IV Ausf H, the M-42 was partially replaced in mass production by more powerful 57 mm ZiS-2 anti-tank gun. The M-42 remained in production, however as it was quite effective against lighter vehicles and could pierce the side armour of Panther and Panzer IV Ausf H. Fragmentation shell and canister shot gave the gun some anti-personnel capability.  Mass production of M-42 ceased in mid-1945. The total number of guns produced is 10,843.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105059;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The ZiS-2 M1941/1943 57mm Anti-Tank Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105059;Design work on the ZiS-2 began in early 1940 for a heavy anti-tank gun.  At that time the Soviet union was not at war so it was not thought that the Red Army would need a heavier gun than the 45mm Anti-Tank Gun they already had.  After the invasion in 1941 there was a lack of a heavier anti-tank and in 1943 with the appearance of the heavy Tiger I and then the Panther, the balance of armored battlefield power changed in favor of the Germans. 45 mm guns model 1942 could only pierce the side armor of the Panther, while the ZiS-3 managed to penetrate the sides from a longer distance. Against the Tiger, the ZiS-3 was effective only from the side at close range (up to 300 m), and 45mm pieces were nearly helpless. A more powerful gun was needed and on June 15, 1943 the ZiS-2 once again entered service as 57-mm anti-tank gun model 1943. Until 1945 9,645 units were produced as a stop gap measure as more 76mm ZiS-3's were produced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105060;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The ZiS-3 M1942 76mm Anti-Tank Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105060;The ZiS-3 was a combination of the light carriage from the 57 mm ZiS-2 anti-tank gun and a powerful 76.2 mm barrel from the previous divisional field gun F-22USV. In order to decrease the gun's recoil a muzzle brake was installed. This allowed the barrel to be mounted on a relatively light carriage without the risk of mechanical damage when firing. In comparison with the F-22USV gun, the ZiS-3 utilized better production technology. Many parts of the gun were cast, stamped or welded in order to reduce the amount of machine work. As a result, the amount of work required to construct a single ZiS-3 gun was one third that of the F-22USV gun. Furthermore, the cost to produce a ZiS-3 gun was only two thirds that of an F-22USV.  The ZiS-3 was the most numerous Soviet Army field gun. The total number of ZiS-3s produced exceeded 103,000 pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105061;New Anti-Air Gun Design: The M1940 25mm Air Defense Gun 72-K;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105061;The 25mm Air Defense Gun 72-K was created in the beginning of 1940 at 8th Kalinin Artillery Plant under the guidance of its Chief Designer.  It was a single-barreled air defense gun system mannded by a crew of five that included a gunner, an assistant gunner and three ammunition feeders.  Although the gun had a good rate of fire due to the type of shell fire it took almost 1,000 rounds to down an enemy aircraft making it not the most effective anti-air gun among the allied nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105062;New Anti-Air Gun Design: The M1938 76mm Air Defense Gun;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105062;This gun was a modernized version of the 76.2 mm air defense gun model 1931, with a slightly modernized barrel and a completely new two-axle carriage ZU-8. This carriage was also used for the more powerful 85 mm 52-K air defense gun, developed in 1939.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105063;New Anti-Air Gun Design: The M1939 85mm Air Defense Gun 52-K;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105063;This gun was successfully used throughout the German-Soviet War against level bombers and other high- and medium-altitude targets. In emergencies they were utilized as powerful anti-tank weapons. The barrel of the 52-K was the basis for the family of 85-mm Soviet tank guns. Crews of 85-mm AD guns shot down 4,047 Axis aircraft. The mean quantity of 85mm ammunition required to shoot down one enemy plane was 598 rounds. After the war some 52-Ks were refitted for peaceful purposes as anti-avalanche guns in mountainous terrain.  Virtually every country behind the Iron Curtain received this gun after World War II for their air defense. In the Soviet Union itself, these guns were largely superseded by the 100 and 130 mm guns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105064;New Anti-Air Gun Design: The 100mm Air Defense Gun KS-19;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105064;The KS-19 is a heavy towed anti aircraft gun that has largely disappeared from front line arsenals due to increased use of more effective surface-to-air missiles. Being a towed weapon an external form of mobility was required, usually an AT-S Medium or AT-T Heavy tracked artillery tractor. The 15 man crew were carried on the tractor along with ready use ammunition for the gun. Ammunition was loaded as a single round into the loading tray and a well trained crew could fire 15 rounds maximum per minute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105065;New Anti-Air Gun Design: The 130mm Air Defense Gun KS-30;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105065;The Soviet 130mm anti-aircraft gun KS-30 appeared in the early 1950s, closely resembling the German wartime 12.8 cm FlaK 40 antiaircraft gun. The KS-30 was used for the home defense forces of the USSR and some other Warsaw Pact countries. Recognition features are the heavy dual-tire carriage, a firing platform which folds up to a 45 degree angle when the piece is in travel, and the long clean tube without a muzzle brake. The breechblock is of the semi-automatic horizontal sliding wedge type, and the piece is fitted with a power rammer and an automatic fuze setter. Fire control is provided by the PUAZO-30 director and the SON-30 radar. The ammunition is of the fixed-charge, separated type. It is not interchangeable with that of the 130mm field or coastal guns. The KS-30 is now held in war reserve since it was replaced by surface-to-air guided missiles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105066;New Self-Propelled Rocket Launcher Design: The BM-13 Katyusha;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105066;Katyusha multiple rocket launchers are a type of rocket artillery first built and fielded by the Soviet Union in World War II. Multiple rocket launchers such as these deliver explosives to a target area more quickly than conventional artillery, but with lower accuracy and requiring a longer time to reload. They are fragile compared to artillery guns, but are inexpensive and easy to produce. Katyushas of World War II, the first self-propelled artillery mass-produced by the Soviet Union, were usually mounted on trucks. This mobility gave the Katyusha (and other self-propelled artillery) another advantage: being able to deliver a large blow all at once, and then move before being located and attacked with counter-battery fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105067;New Self-Propelled Rocket Launcher Design: The BM-8 Katyusha;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105067;The BM-8 was the first launcher of the series and it fired 82 mm rockets at a range of up to 6,400 meters. The BM-8 also served as the lighter version of the series and could feature anywhere from eight to forty-eight rocket launch tubes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105068;New Self-Propelled Rocket Launcher Design: The BM-31 Katyusha;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105068;The BM-31 was a version of the Katyusha Rocket Launchers mounted on the Studebaker US6 U3 truck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105069;New Self-Propelled Rocket Launcher Design: The BM-14 Katyusha;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105069;The BM-14, is a Soviet-made 140mm multiple launch rocket system (MLRS), normally mounted on a truck.  The BM-14 can fire 140mm M-14 rockets with a high-explosive fragmentation warhead, a smoke warhead or a chemical warhead. It is similar to the BM-13 "Katyusha" and was partly replaced in service by the 122mm BM-21 Grad.  Launchers were built in 16 and 17-round variants. The rockets have a maximum range of 9.8 kilometers (6.1 mi).  The weapon is not accurate as there is no guidance system, but it is extremely effective in saturation fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105070;New Self-Propelled Rocket Launcher Design: The BM-21 Katyusha Grad;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105070;The BM-21 launch vehicle, (Grad) a Soviet truck-mounted 122 mm multiple rocket launcher, and a M-21OF rocket were developed in the early 1960s. BM stands for Boyevaya Mashina (combat vehicle), and the nickname Grad means "hail". The complete system with the BM-21 launch vehicle and the M-21OF rocket is designated as the M-21 Field Rocket System. The complete system is more commonly known as a Grad multiple rocket launcher system. In NATO countries, the system (either the complete system or the launch vehicle only) was initially known as M1964. Several other countries have copied it or developed similar systems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105071;New Assault Gun Design: The SU-76 Assault Gun;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105071;The SU-76 was a Soviet self-propelled gun used during and after World War II. The SU-76 was based on a lengthened and widened version of the T-70 light tank chassis. Its simple construction made it the second most produced Soviet armoured vehicle of World War II, after the T-34 tank. Crews liked the vehicle for its simplicity, reliability, and ease of use. More than 13,000 SU-76's were produced during the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105072;New Assault Gun Design: The SU-122 Assault Gun;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105072;The SU-122 was a Soviet self-propelled howitzer or assault gun used during World War II. The number "122" in the designation represents the caliber of the main armament—a 122 mm M-30S howitzer. The chassis was that of the T-34. The SU-122 proved effective in its intended role of direct fire on strongholds. The massive concussion of the 122mm HE round was reportedly enough to blow the turret off even a Tiger I if a direct hit was scored at close range, although longer range penetration against heavier German armor remained poor, a trait shared with the larger 152mm howitzers. The new BP-460A HEAT projectile was introduced in May 1943; however its primitive warhead design was only minimally more effective than brute concussive effects of the old HE shell at close range.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105073;New Assault Gun Design: The SU-152 Assault Gun;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105073;The SU-152 was a Soviet self-propelled heavy howitzer used during World War II. It mounted a 152 mm gun-howitzer on the chassis of a KV-1S heavy tank. Later production used an IS tank chassis and was re-designated ISU-152. Because of its adopted role as an impromptu heavy tank destroyer, capable of knocking out the heaviest German armoured vehicles—Tiger and Panther tanks, and Elefant tank destroyers—it was nicknamed Zveroboy ("Beast Slayer").;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105074;New Heavy Assault Gun Design: The ISU-122 Assault Gun;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105074;The ISU-122 was used as a powerful assault gun, a self-propelled howitzer, and a long-range tank destroyer, the same as with the SU-152 and ISU-152 heavy self-propelled guns in general. However these vehicles differed in their combat use. The primary application of the ISU-122 was as a tank destroyer, while the SU/ISU-152 tended more towards the assault gun role. With the same hull as the IS-2 the ISU-122 had good armour performance but more importantly very good performance with high-explosive rounds. The 122mm gun had great potential, although the gun's abilities were somewhat reduced by the available projectiles and its lack of accuracy. In 1944 the BR-471 was the sole armour-piercing round available. An improved version, the BR-471B (БР-471Б) was developed in early 1945, but was available in quantity only after World War II ended. In extremis the ISU-122 engaged enemy heavy armour with OF-471 high explosive projectiles. These shells had a mass of 25 kg, a muzzle velocity of 800 m/s, and were equipped with a 3 kg TNT charge. Mechanical shock and explosion was often enough to knock out enemy AFVs without any armour penetration. For urban combat ISU-122's were utilized as assault guns, but with a lower efficiency in comparison to the SU/ISU-152. In general Red Army commanders viewed the ISU-122 as a good assault gun. The OF-471 projectile was powerful enough against unprotected and entrenched infantry, pillboxes, and fortified buildings. In urban combat the long barrel of the 121.92-mm cannon sometimes made maneuvering difficult. Use of the ISU-122 as a self-propelled howitzer was rare, although its maximum range of fire exceeded 14 km. Usually the ISU-122 delivered indirect fire to the enemy during rapid advances when support from towed artillery was not available.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105075;New Heavy Assault Gun Design: The ISU-152 Assault Gun;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105075;The ISU-152 was armed with the same gun as the SU-152. It used the hull of the IS-1 tank instead of the KV-1S. Later in the war the ISU-152 was further improved. It used the hull of the IS-2 or IS-2 model 1944 tank, the armour of the mantlet was increased, the gun was replaced by newer variants, a 12.7 x 108 mm DShK anti-aircraft machine gun was installed by the right forward hatch and later its ammunition capacity increased, the 10R radio set was upgraded to a 10RK and the fuel capacity was increased. Some ISU-152s were equipped with even larger external fuel tanks, two tanks on the rear hull deck, in addition to the four external fuel tanks (90 litres each, maximum), or with two smaller additional external fuel tanks, on the hull rear. This option was probably available for the post-war ISU-152 variants. Between December 1943 and May 1945, 1,885 ISU-152s were built. Mass production ceased in 1947, with 3,242 vehicles produced in total.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105076;New SP Anti-Air Gun Design: The ZSU-37 SP Anti-Air Gun;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105076;The ZSU-37 was based on the SU-76M because it also shared its technical drawbacks and advantages, the most discussed of which was the open-top turret. To protect the crew from rain and snow the gun compartment could be covered with tarpaulin, however the gun could not be fully elevated when this was done. The open turret had advantages, such as high elevation angle, excellent visibility for the gunners and no need for ventilation. Light and manoeuvrable, the ZSU-37 was considered quite an effective SPAAG in the mid-1940s. However, it had insufficient off-road capabilities to accompany medium and heavy tanks in difficult terrain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105077;New Infantry Tank Design: The BT-5 Infantry Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105077;Aside from the turret, the BT-5 could hardly be distinguished from its predecessor, the BT-4. The hulls were identical, with the same internal arrangement and the same Mikulin M5 engine, supplying 400 hp. The armor was unchanged, ranging from 6 to 13 mm, in no way capable of withstanding even antitank rifle fire. Speed was seen as active protection. The big difference was the turret, similar to the model 1933 T-26 two-men turret with a 45mm model 32 gun, the new standard Soviet AT gun. 115 rounds were carried, 72 for commander tanks with a radio. A DT-5 coaxial machine-gun completed the armament. There was no commander cupola, just simple escape hatches. The turret itself increased the overall weight to 11.5 tons, and performance degraded accordingly. Top speed was 72 km/h instead of 100 km/h and the gas tank was shrunk to 360 liters instead of 400 liters. The engine now gave a 35 hp/ton ratio and maximum range was decreased from 300 to 200 km (tactical range 90 km). But all this was sacrificed for largely improved firepower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105078;New Infantry Tank Design: The BT-7 Cavalry Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105078;The BT-7 was derived from the 1930's American-built Christie tank, perfected and modified into the BT-2 and BT-5 series. These were pure cavalry tanks, designed for speed, with good armament but weak armor. First designed in 1935, the BT-7 prototypes had a characteristic canted-ellipse shaped turret, were of all-electric welded construction, with new Saslavsky brakes, new main clutch and slightly thicker armor. The tracks had a smaller pitch and fuel capacity was increased. Specifications asked that heavier guns should be mounted instead of the standard 20K model 1932/38 45mm, the 75mm short barrel KT-26 and PS-3 howitzers for infantry support. The mantlet had a coaxial DT machine-gun and a rotating drum-type magazine for 18 rounds was stored in the rear basket. This complicated turret design was later dropped and the model BT-7 1935 was built using the BT-5 standard turret instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105079;New Infantry Tank Design: The BT-7M Cavalry Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105079;This final evolution, sometimes called BT-7 model 1940, was born from the four experimental BT-8s. These were equipped with a new V12 diesel engine produced at the Voroshilovets factory and derived from the Hispano-Suiza 12Y aircraft engine. A sloped nose glacis replaced the old pointed nose. The BT-7M eventually showed a much higher endurance and overall range, and replaced the BT-7-2 on the production lines. They would become the ancestor of the T-34 family and were produced from 1939 to mid-1941, when the factory plants were dismantled to be relocated further east. Around 700 BT-7Ms were produced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105080;New Light Tank Design: The T-26 Light Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105080;The T-26 was a light tank based on the British Vicker Mark E.  It was good and fast light tank that was later equipped with a 45mm gun. What is remarkable in tank history are a few landmarks which push over new boundaries through a single particularity or technical achievement. For the T-26, this was production, and there is no doubt such a doubt had to be achieved in the USSR. By then, Stalin desperately pushed this gigantic rural country to a forced, careless march towards industrial might. With less engineering sophistication than contemporary western models, the T-26 was ideally suited for mass-production, and ultimately reached an astonishing 10,000 units in September 1939. This tank alone made the Red Army, by far, the biggest armored force the world had ever seen. Even in the summer of 1941, German armor was overwhelmed by a four to one ratio and the Panzers would soon be confronted, on a daily basis, with swarms of such light tanks. Simply put, it was the mainstay of the Red Army, playing the same task during these pre-war years as the mythical T-34 during the "great patriotic war".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105081;New Tankette Design: The T-37A Tankette;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105081;The first mass-produced amphibious tank, the T-37A was built in relatively small numbers and used throughout the entire war.  Largely based on the Vickers design, the T-37A was only superficially as simple machine. It had a large (1/2 length/width ratio), low rectangular hull, with rounded ends for better hydrodynamic qualities, high "mud-guards" which also served as waterwings, with the GAZ-AA engine at the rear, driver compartment on left and turret on the right.  It proved itself to be a useful reconnaissance vehicle but it lacked any kind of heavy firepower to sustain itself in combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105082;New Light Tank Design: The T-60 Light Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105082;The T-60 was the result of ongoing developments in light tanks that had started well before WWII. This particular tank started development in 1938 as an attempt to replace the T-26, T-40, failed T-46 project, and the T-50. Whilst such a large number were produced, it was hated by all who had to deal with it – all except the Germans who found it to be a substandard and underwhelming opponent, and a rather nice ammunition carrier or gun towing tractor, once captured. As a result of its poor armor, substandard armament, and sluggish performance, it was more dangerous to its crews than anybody else, earning it the title Bratskaya Mogila na Dovoikh, literally: “a brother’s grave for two.”  In action the T-60 was simply dreadful. As a result of the combination of inferior Armour, a sub-standard main gun, poor mobility, and a two-man crew, it was universally hated by the Soviets. In a meeting with Stalin in 1942, Major-General M.E. Katukov said: “It has only a 20mm gun. In serious combat with armored forces, it just does not have it … To attack in mud or snow is a deadly affair. In the battles around Moscow, we continually had to drag them in tow.”  Later Soviet Commanders sometimes praised the T-60 in that at least it was better than nothing and some were even successful with it against German infantry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105083;New Light Tank Design: The T-70 Light Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105083;The T-70 was a light tank used by the Red Army during World War II, replacing both the T-60 scout tank for reconnaissance and the T-50 light infantry tank for infantry support. The T-80 light tank was a more advanced version of the T-70 with a two-man turret—it was only produced in very small numbers when light tank production was abandoned. The T-90 self-propelled anti-aircraft gun was a prototype vehicle with twin machine guns, based on the T-70 chassis. The T-70 was armed with a 45-mm L/46 gun Model 38 with forty-five rounds carried, and a coaxial 7.62-mm DT machine gun. The tank was operated by a driver and a commander who loaded and fired the gun. Armour thickness on the turret front was 60 mm, turret sides and rear: 35 mm, hull front and sides: 45 mm, roof and bottom: 10 mm. By 1942, light tanks were considered inadequate by the Red Army, unable to keep up with the T-34 medium tank and unable to penetrate the armour of most German tanks, but they could be produced by small factories which were unable to handle the large components of medium and heavy tanks. The T-70 was an attempt to remedy some of the shortcomings of the T-60 scout tank, which had very poor cross-country mobility, thin armour, and an inadequate 20-mm gun. It also replaced the very short production run of the T-50 light infantry tank, which was more sophisticated, but also much too complicated and expensive to produce. They completely replaced T-60 production in September 1942, although that tank remained in use until the end of the war. Production ended in October 1943, with 8,226 vehicles completed. The T-70 remained in service until 1948.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105084;New Medium Tank Design: The T-28 Medium Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105084;The T-28 is almost a footnote in Soviet tank production compared to its little brother, the T-26. However, it was the first truly indigenous Russian design and one of the first medium tanks ever built in the world, at least in a large-scale series. Based on a specification, in 1929, for a pure infantry support and breakthrough tank, able to deal with fortified positions and for exploitation by mechanized brigades. Its cavalry equivalent was the BT. The T-28 inherited the Soviet interest for British -and especially Vickers- ideas, which started with the licence-built T-23 tankette.  When operation Barbarossa began, with a production figure limited to 500 (600 from other sources), compared to the 10,300 T-26s and thousands of BTs, and with the Winter War losses, it was a relatively rare sight for the Wehrmacht.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105085;New Medium Tank Design: The T-34 Medium Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105085;The T-34 was and remains a legend. It is not only the most produced tank of WWII, with 84,000 in built (compared to the 48,966 Shermans of all versions) but also one of the longest-serving tanks ever built. Many are still extent in depots in Asia and Africa, some served actively during the 90's (like during the 1991-99 Yugoslavian war). They were part of countless armored forces around the globe from the fifties to the eighties. The basic design was drawn for the first time in 1938 with the A-32, derived from the BT-7M, a late evolution of the US-borne Christie tank. The first version T-34/76 came as a nasty surprise for the overconfident German troops in the fall of 1941, when it was first committed en masse. The Germans had nothing comparable. Not only were they able to cope with the mud and snow with their large tracks, but they came with a perfect combination of thick and highly sloped armor, efficient gun, good speed and autonomy and, above all, extreme sturdiness, reliability, ease of manufacturing and maintenance. A perfect winner for an industrial war and a significant leap in tank design.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105086;New Medium Tank Design: The T-44 Medium Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105086;The T-44 is a medium tank first produced near the end of the World War II by the Soviet Union. It was the successor to the T-34, offering improved ride and cross-country performance and much greater armor. Designed to be equipped with a powerful 85 mm main gun, by the time it was fully tested the T-34 had also moved to this weapon. Both tanks offered similar performance, so introducing the T-44 was not considered as important as increasing T-34 production. Fewer than 2,000 T-44s were built, compared to about 84,000 T-34s. Although the T-44 was available by the end of the war, they were not used in combat.  Attempts were made to improve the T-44's armament with a new 122 mm gun, but the turret proved very cramped and the rate of fire was poor, on the order of three rounds per minute. Another attempt with a 100 mm gun seemed more promising although a number of additional changes would be needed to make a truly effective design. Design work on a slightly enlarged version of the T-44 began during the war and a prototype was produced in 1945. This newer design entered production in 1947 as the T-54/55 series of medium tanks, the most-produced tank of all time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105087;New Heavy Tank Design: The T-35 Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105087;The T-35 was a Soviet multi-turreted heavy tank of the interwar period and early Second World War that saw limited production and service with the Red Army. It was the only five-turreted heavy tank in the world to reach production, but proved to be slow and mechanically unreliable. Most of the T-35 tanks still operational at the time of Operation Barbarossa were lost due to mechanical failure rather than enemy action. Outwardly, it was large, but internally, the spaces were cramped with the fighting compartments separated from each other. Some of the turrets obscured the entrance hatches. The multi-turret configuration, large size and high price of the T-35 was clearly mirroring the role of a battleship on land. Although it was not specifically designed as a breakthrough tank, there was clearly a place for it in the Soviet "deep battle" tactic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105088;New Heavy Tank Design: The KV-1 Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105088;After the T-28, which was considered a medium, infantry tank design, the T-35 became the first of these heavy tanks to enter service with the USSR. This was a true monster, influenced by the multi-turreted fad which came from Great Britain, but was quite complicated and unsatisfactory in operations.  A new 1937 specification gave birth to the two T-100s and the unique SMK prototype, showing a new arrangement of firepower, with tandem turrets. All three were tested in operations in Finland during the "Winter War" (September-December 1939). They proved resistant but showed very poor reliability and mobility. They were also costly, over-complicated and difficult to maintain. Another prototype however, the KV, had been drawn by the same team which designed the SMK, as a single-turreted variant. During these operations, the two KV prototypes outperformed the others and the type was subsequently approved for a 50-unit pre-series under the name of KV-1.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105089;New Heavy Tank Design: The KV-1B Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105089;The KV-1B had improved armor thickness up to 100mm and a cast armor turret along with a long barreled F-34 main gun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105090;New Heavy Tank Design: The KV-1S Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105090;The main criticism about the weight imposed a completely revised version with somewhat "downgraded armor" in order to regain some agility. In fact, this was not an equal sacrifice. Some vital parts, determined after carefully studied statistics about tank loss reports, were still well protected, while sacrificing others. This was a near "all-or-nothing" protection, which also came with special tactical maneuvers instructions in order to reduce the exposure of these "weak spots" to the enemy. However, the engine was untouched. Another improvement concerned the cast turret, which was redesigned completely, lower, smaller, with slightly sloped sides and, most importantly for the first time, fitted with a real commander cupola bearing all-around vision blocks, which in turn greatly improved the overall vision and efficiency of the commander. However, this KV-1S (for "Skorostnoy" - "fast"), was still much more expensive than the T-34/76, for the relative same performances. By late 1943 there were concerns about the cancellation of this new version, which occurred after 1370 had been delivered, from autumn 1942 to the fall of 1943. Total weight was 42 tons, and protection ranged from 30 to 75mm. The main armament, a 76.2mm L42, was fed by 114 rounds, and the three DT machine-guns by 3000 rounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105091;New Heavy Tank Design: The KV-85 Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105091;Another strong criticism about the KV-1 concerned its main armament, which was the same as the medium main tank of the Red Army, the T-34. But the KV-1 was more expensive and with far less mobility. A better gun could have effectively saved the KV-1, making something comparable to the last version of the Panzer IV or the Tiger. By 1943, Lieutenant-Colonel Kotin technical bureau was split in two, a part being affected to studying a new stopgap heavy tank based on the KV-1, waiting for its replacement to come. The team naturally chose the improved KV-1S, but increased the armor protection in vital parts to 110mm, and widened slightly the hull to accommodate a larger turret and gun, the 85mm D-5T which was also chosen to equip the IS-85 (forerunner of the famous IS-1). Due to this interim position, the KV-85 was only produced in limited quantity by the beginning of 1943. 143 units of this ultimate version will be delivered until the production stopped for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105092;New Heavy Tank Design: The IS-2 Mod.1943 Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105092;The first version of the IS-2 was equipped with the A19 gun, started in November 1943 at Chelyabinsk factory. Initial proposals for the turret included a 152mm howitzer, a 50mm mortar turret capable of launching smoke shells or flares and, most importantly, a fully revolving commander cupola also serving a DSHT heavy machine gun, intended for AA defense and finally accepted in the definitive production design. The second great innovative figure of the IS-2 was its new frontal armour, still stepped, but uniformly "blended", with 120 mm, offering better resistance while still saving weight. Thanks to this, the glacis could now withstand a 88 mm AP shell at 1000m. Because of the large recoil mechanism of the gun and a 1800mm turret ring radius, the internal space was cramped and only permitted a four-man crew, the commander having to command, order fire and make radio contact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105093;New Heavy Tank Design: The IS-2 Mod.1944 Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105093;By 1944 a new version of the 122mm gun, the D-25T, already tested in January on a single IS-122, was accepted in service to replace the A19. It had a 780-790 m/sec muzzle velocity and could penetrate 140mm of armour at 500m. But, most important, the breech mechanism, although still semi-automatic, was geared to sustain a reduced loading time. The design team also wanted a more protective turret, but the added armour would lead to an unbalanced design, thus forcing the redesign of many other parts of the tank. But since production was paramount the project was cancelled. The problems of internal glacis armour plate releasing fragments when hit was solved thanks to the experts of the CRI-48 tank builders which developed a new form of armour plates, as well as improved the manufacturing technologies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105094;New Heavy Tank Design: The IS-3 Mod.1945 Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105094;The IS-3 was only superficially a major departure from previous heavy tanks, with a lineage including the KV-1 (1939), KV-1S, KV-85, IS-85, IS-1 and the IS-2. The IS-3 had a new front hull and a new turret shape which became the trademark of all postwar Soviet tanks to date. Because of multiple issues, production was cut short and it was followed by the ponderous IS-4, the prototypes IS-6, IS-7 and, finally, the IS-10 (rebaptised T-10 after the death of Stalin). Because of poor mobility the Russians reached the same conclusions as their western counterparts regarding heavy tanks. This class of vehicles was abandoned in the West as well after 1953, after the first cruiser-derived MBTs had revealed a new way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105095;New Tank Destroyer Design: The SU-85 Tank Destroyer;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105095;Designed to kill the Tiger, called "Samokhodnaya Ustanovka" or "SU" (self-propelled carriage), with the successful D-5T high velocity antitank gun, from which it got its name, the SU-85 was in fact a provisional measure, being provided in a hurry in large quantities, waiting for the new T-34/85 to arrive. For this purpose, the SU-85 was based on the SU-122, a 122 mm (4.8 in) howitzer gun carriage, itself based on the T-34 chassis with a fixed superstructure, far easier to built, and presenting a low profile. German tank destroyers also like the Sturmgeschütz III and, later, the Jägdpanther, gave the example. It was the beginning of the casemate-style turretless hulls in Soviet service. Thorough tests, based on a modified SU-122 gun carrier, were executed with a derivative of the 85mm AA gun. This gun was completely refitted for antitank service, under the name of D-5S. The Uralmash factory, which already built the SU-122, rejected the new design as it took too long to convert for mass production in this new configuration. The factory directors were convinced and, after many trials and several rejected testbeds, the last prototype equipped with the D-5T was approved for production in May 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105096;New Tank Destroyer Design: The SU-100 Tank Destroyer;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105096;By mid-1944 the SU-85 already proved unable to penetrate the sloped armor of the late Panthers and Tigers. At the same time, the T-34/85 was equipped with the same gun, but with a 360 degree arc of fire, arriving en masse to the front. The SU-85's days were counted and despite the arrival of the new improved SU-85M, a new design based on a better antitank gun was needed to keep the edge on the battlefield in terms of tank-hunters. Closely related to the SU-85, the SU-100 incorporated much of its design, around the new D10 100mm  anti-tank gun. Chief designer was L. I. Gorlitskiy, who created the "Obyekt 138" in February 1944, the prototype designed to test several 100mm mounts. Only one, the D-10S, from the Constructors Bureau of Artillery Factory No. 9, was retained. It showed excellent performance, being able to pierce 120mm armor at up to 2000 meters and the sloped 85 mm frontal armor of the Panther at 1500m. In fact this gun, and postwar derivatives, equipped the Russian main battle tanks T-54 and T-55 and was in service with many armies around in the world. The SU-100 was built at the Ural Heavy Machinery Factory (Uralmash), with a thicker frontal glacis, which rose to 75mm, and a newly designed casemate, with a more pronounced slope, sacrificing some habitability. However, it was equipped with a new, well-conceived commander cupola, and the crew compartment was cooler due to a second ventilator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
##########################################################################################;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105097;New Main Battle Tank Design: The T-54 Main Battle Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105097;The T-54 is a legend. It was used more extensively that any other Cold War or modern MBT to date. It was supplied to or produced by Warsaw pact countries, forming the bulk of their forces during the 1960s-70s. Then it served with the allies in the Middle East (Egypt, Syria, Jordan) and numerous nations among the non-aligned and third world countries. A staggering 83,500 were produced, alongside the Polish and Czech versions (21,000 more). It was largely associated with colonial or independence wars all around the globe and is still one of the most common pieces of equipment of any armored force today. China copied the T-54 under the Type 59 designation and it was also largely distributed among Asiatic nations, notably North Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and North Korea. Several factors contributed to this success, which has some obvious similarities to the infamous Kalashnikov. First, mass-production made it not only largely available, but also the cheapest proposition for a modern MBT. Production spanned fifteen years, but modernization and upgrades were constant, up to the 1990s. Spare parts were also made largely available, for the same reason. Second, it was a good-all-around MBT, achieving the same balance in this respect as the famous T-34. Third, it was simple to operate, with a straightforward internal ergonomy. Fourth, it was very sturdy, dependable and easily adaptable. Now there are perhaps more than two hundred local variants, some of which are still in use today, not only the local conversions, upgrades and spin-offs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105098;New Super Heavy Tank Design: The IS-4 Super Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105098;The IS tanks family was driven by Stalin's obsession for heavy tanks, only matched by Hitler's own obsession of "super-tanks" as well as for practical reasons: The T34 was no more a match for Germans tanks after 1943. The IS-4 was still in the straight line of successors for the KV-1 and followed the path of the IS-2 heavy tanks (1944). The only purpose of the whole series, which will end only after the death of Stalin himself, was to match and surpass the 1943 German generation of tanks, armed with 88 mm or "long" 75 mm both in terms of protection and firepower. These tanks had a 120 mm set as a new standard, that can also provide a potent infantry support with its heavy HE shells. At the time the first lines of the IS-3 were drawn in 1944, the very same team (LKZ) and development bureau was working on an alternative model, the IS-4. The latter was conceived as a less advanced, therefore cheaper version of the IS-3 but differed considerably on several points. It was delayed, then later produced, and seen as an overall less successful design. It will be sent to a less important theatre of operation for its entire cold war service duration, and is nowadays largely eclipsed by the IS-3.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105099;New Armored Personnel Carrier Design: The BTR-50 APC;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105099;The BTR-50 answered to a specification for an amphibious, tracked APC, at a time were the two wheeled APCs in service, the BTR-40 and the BTR-152 lacked good off-road capabilities and were only unable to ford small rivers. The same design bureau responsible for the PT-76 light tank, the Leningrad ChTz factory complex (Chelyabinsk) VNII-100 institute, proposed a variant of this vehicle which had the required characteristics, and after initial trials of the Ob'yekt 750 prototypes between 1952 and 1954, it was eventually accepted in service and the production started in 1954.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105100;New Airborne Tank Destroyer Design: The ASU-57 57mm Airborne Tank Destroyer;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105100;The ASU-57 was the first successful soviet airborne tank design. In the 1930s, when airborne divisions were first set-up and pioneered following the definition of the deep battle concept, many air dropping solutions were tried, with amphibious and light tanks and tankettes, but all failed at the end. In the 1950s, when the ASU-57 was introduced,	all airborne divisions received 54 vehicles each. Early tests were performed under the Tu-4 bomber wings. However at the end of the 1950s, only 245 ASU-57 were in service, and the gun, derived of a 1943 design, was seen as obsolete. NATO airborne equivalent was the vastly superior 106 mm recoiless gun. The ASU-57 was kept in service for 20 years, before being phased out in the 1980s, and gradually replaced by the heavier ASU-85, as capacity in airlift cargo capacity was raised in parallel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105101;New Amphibious Light Tank Design: The PT-76 Light Amphibious Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105101;The PT-76 (named after its main gun) was the first new postwar soviet light tank. There was a tradition of buiding light amphibious tanks dating back with the local adaptation of the Vickers amphibious 1929 vehicle and the prewar T-37A, T-38 and wartime T-40, all mass-produced. But these vehicles were quite slow in water and improvements were needed. At Leningrad ChTz factory complex (Chelyabinsk) VNII-100 institute the "obyekt 740" designed by the engineer N. Shashmurin was presented in 1949. It was originally co-designed with Zh. Kotin from the Kirov Plant and the first tests proved successful. It had good overall performances and an innovative water-jet design system. This was followed by a final prototype built at Kirov Plant in 1950, and after a second campaign, the vehicle was adopted on August 6, 1951 as the PT-76.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105102;New Super Heavy Tank Design: The IS-10/T-10;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105102;The IS-10 (also known as Objekt 730) was the final development of the KV and IS tank series. It was accepted into service in 1952 as the IS-10, but due to the political climate in the wake of Stalin's death in 1953, it was renamed T-10. The biggest differences from its direct ancestor, the IS-3, were a longer hull, seven pairs of road wheels instead of six, a larger turret mounting a new gun with fume extractor, an improved diesel engine, and increased armour. General performance was similar, although the T-10 could carry more ammunition. T-10s (like the earlier tanks they replaced) were deployed in independent tank regiments belonging to armies, and independent tank battalions belonging to divisions. These independent tank units could be attached to mechanized units, to support infantry operations and perform breakthroughs. This was the last Soviet heavy tank to enter service. When the advanced T-64 MBT became available it replaced the T-10 in front line formations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105103;New Self-Propelled Anti-Air Gun Design: The ZSU-57-2 SP AA Gun;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105103;The ZSU-57-2 is a Soviet self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG), armed with two 57 mm autocannons. 'ZSU' stands for Zenitnaya Samokhodnaya Ustanovka, meaning "anti-aircraft self-propelled mount", '57' stands for the bore of the armament in millimetres and '2' stands for the number of gun barrels. It was the first Soviet mass-produced tracked SPAAG. In the USSR it had the unofficial nickname "Sparka", meaning "pair", referring to the twin autocannon with which the vehicle is armed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105104;New Super Heavy SP Artillery Gun Design: The 2B1 Oka SP Super Heavy Artillery Gun;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105104;Historically the 2B1 was an experimental model was ready in 1957. Its chassis (Object 273), was designed and built by the Kirov Plant. Its 20 meter barrel allowed it to fire 750 kg rounds up to 45 km. Due to its complexity of loading it had a relatively low rate of fire—one round every five minutes. Field tests showed various drawbacks of the entire design (the recoil was too strong for many components: it damaged drive sprockets, tore the gear-box away from its mountings, etc.) and the sheer length rendered it incredibly difficult to transport. Its development continued until 1960, when the idea of such overpowered guns, was abandoned in favor of tactical ballistic missiles, such as the 2K6 Luna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105105;New Main Battle Tank Design: The T-55 Main Battle Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105105;The all-improved T-55 was developed from 1955-58 onward at the Uralvagonzavod plant. It was basically the sum of upgrades performed on the former T-54s, but with full NBC protection called PAZ (Protivoatomnaya Zashchita), studied by the KB-60 design bureau in Kharkov.  It was intended to counter the new M60 Patton Tank from the United States.  It's main feature over the T-54 is that it came standard with Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Warfare protection systems.  It had some armor upgrades over the T-54 but it's weaponry basically remained the same. Historically over 27,000 manufactured from 1955 and on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105106;New Armored Personnel Carrier Design: The BTR-60 APC;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105106;With the BTR-152 and BTR-40, the soviet army had the experience with APCs needed to make evolve the type. The two model greatest issue (to be open-top) was corrected in mid- or late-production, but their real limitations were fully exposed in combat during the Suez crisis. The reports published after the actions had the seeds of a new design, which was eventually led to the first all-enclosed, NBC, amphibious, six or eight-wheeled BPC in the formula familiar to us now. In 1956-57 a decision was made to built two kind of APCs to serve different units. The tanks divisions would have the tracked BMP-1, while the rifle (infantry) divisions would be equipped with a cheaper wheeled APC or "armoured car".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105107;New Anti-Aircraft Gun Design: The ZU-23 Anti-Air Gun;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105107;The ZU-23-2 was developed in the late 1950s. It was designed to engage low-flying targets at a range of 2.5 km as well as armoured vehicles at a range of two kilometres (km) and for direct defense of troops and strategic locations against air assault usually conducted by helicopters and low-flying airplanes. In 1955, KBP presented the single-barrel ZU-1 and the twin-barrel ZU-14. While the former was eventually dropped, the ZU-14 was selected and, after some modifications, entered series production. In the Soviet Union, some 140,000 units were produced. Development of this weapon into a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG) led to the ZSU-23-4 Shilka.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105108;New Main Battle Tank Design: The T-62 Main Battle Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105108;The T-62 is a main battle tank, a further development of the T-55. Its 115 mm gun was the first smoothbore tank gun in use. The T-62 was produced between 1961 and 1975. It became a standard tank in the Soviet arsenal, partly replacing the T-55, although that tank continued to be manufactured in the Soviet Union and elsewhere after T-62 production was halted.  Historically over 27,000 were produced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105109;New SP AA Gun Design: The ZSU-23 Shilka;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105109;The ZSU-23-4 "Shilka" is a lightly armored, self-propelled, radar guided anti-aircraft weapon system (SPAAG). The acronym "ZSU" stands for Zenitnaya Samokhodnaya Ustanovka, meaning "anti-aircraft self-propelled mount". The "23" signifies the bore diameter in millimeters, the "4" signifies the number of gun barrels. It is named after the Russian Shilka River. Afghan soldiers nicknamed it the "sewing machine" due to the sound of firing guns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105110;New Armored Personnel Carrier Design: The BMP-1 Armored Personnel Carrier;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105110;The BMP-1 is a Soviet amphibious tracked infantry fighting vehicle. BMP stands for Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty 1, meaning "infantry fighting vehicle". The BMP-1 was the first mass-produced infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) of USSR. It was called the M-1967, BMP and BMP-76PB by NATO before its correct designation was known. The Soviet military leadership saw any future wars as being conducted with nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and a new design combining the properties of an armored personnel carrier (APC) and a light tank like the BMP would allow infantry to operate from the relative safety of its armoured, radiation-shielded interior in contaminated areas and to fight alongside it in uncontaminated areas. It would increase infantry squad mobility, provide fire support to them, and also be able to fight alongside main battle tanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105111;New Main Battle Tank Design: The T-64 Main Battle Tank;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105111;The T-64 is a Soviet second-generation main battle tank introduced in the early 1960s. It was a more advanced counterpart to the T-62: the T-64 served tank divisions, while the T-62 supported infantry in motor rifle divisions. Although the T-62 and the famous T-72 would see much wider use and generally more development, it was the T-64 that formed the basis of more modern Soviet tank designs, such as the T-80.  A revolutionary feature of the T-64 is the incorporation of an automatic loader for its 125-mm gun, allowing one crew member's position to be omitted and helping to keep the size and weight of the tank down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105112;New Assault Rifle Design: The AKM Assault Rifle;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105112;Compared to the AK-47, the AKM features detail improvements and enhancements that optimized the rifle for mass production; some parts and assemblies were conceived using simplified manufacturing methods. Notably, the AK-47's milled steel receiver was replaced by a U-shaped steel stamping. As a result of these modifications, the AKM’s weight was reduced by approx. 1kg, the accuracy during automatic fire was increased and several reliability issues were addressed. The AK-47's chrome-lined barrel was retained, a common feature of Soviet weapons which resists wear and corrosion, particularly under harsh field conditions and near-universal Eastern Bloc use of corrosively primed ammunition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105113;New Rocket Propelled Grenade Design: The RPG-7;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105113;The RPG-7 was a further improvement upon the RPG-2.  The ruggedness, simplicity, low cost, and effectiveness of the RPG-7 has made it the most widely used anti-armor weapon in the world. Currently around 40 countries use the weapon, and it is manufactured in several variants by nine countries. It is popular with irregular and guerrilla forces. The RPG has been used in almost all conflicts across all continents since the mid-1960s from the Vietnam War to the early 2010s War in Afghanistan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105114;New Light Machine Gun Design: The RPK Light Machine Gun;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105114;Developed parallel with the AKM assault rifle, it was created as part of a program designed to standardize the small arms inventory of the Red Army, where it replaced the 7.62×39mm RPD light machine gun.  It is very reliable has a good rate of fire for a portable light machine gun design.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105115;New Man Portable Anti-Air Design: The SA-7 MANPAD;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105115;The SA-7 was the worlds first low altitude man portable air defense system.  Meant to be carried by an infantryman it has a short range but was effective at shooting down low flying aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
