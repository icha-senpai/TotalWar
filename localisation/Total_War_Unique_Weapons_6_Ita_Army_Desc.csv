EVTNAME9105900;New Bolt Action Rifle Design: The Carcano Modello 1891 (M91);;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105900;Carcano is the frequently used name for a series of Italian bolt-action military rifles and carbines. Introduced in 1891, this rifle was chambered for the rimless 6.5x52mm Mannlicher cartridge (Cartuccia Modello 1895). It was developed by the chief technician Salvatore Carcano at the Turin Army Arsenal in 1890 and called the Modello (model) 91 or simply M91. Successively replacing the previous Vetterli-Vitali rifles and carbines in 10.35x47mmR, it was produced from 1892 to 1945. The M91 was used in both rifle (fucile) and carbine (moschetto) form by most Italian troops during the First World War and by Italian and some German forces during the Second World War. The rifle was also used during the Winter War by Finland, and again by regular and irregular forces in Syria, Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria during various postwar conflicts in those countries.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105901;New Submachine Gun Design: The Beretta Model 1918;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105901;The Beretta Model 1918 was a submachine gun that entered service in 1918 with the Italian armed forces. Designed initially as a semi-automatic rifle, the weapon came with an overhead inserted magazine, an unconventional design based on the simplicity of allowing a spent round to be replaced using only gravity. The gun was a spiritual successor to the Villar Perosa Submachine gun, and as such it can be considered the first submachine gun issued to and used by the Italian armed forces, and is possibly the first SMG used as a general-issue combat weapon.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105902;New Submachine Gun Design: The Beretta Model 38A;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105902;Beretta MAB 38, in its first variants, was a fine weapon by any standard, crafted with high quality materials and flawlessly finished, carefully machined parts. Although successive models 38/42 and 38/44 were easier and faster to build, sacrificing finish to gain speed, thw overall quality of production remained high. Its mechanism was a traditional simple blowback recoil, but featured notable mechanical solutions, such as a floating firing pin, an automatic safety on open bolt (both later removed to save production costs), a recoil compensator on the muzzle, a bolt cocking handle with sliding dust cover, and a striking trigger gear with no fire selector, but with two triggers instead: the fore trigger for semiautomatic fire and rear trigger for full-auto fire. This was meant to allow the shooter to shift quickly through both firing modes, without switching levers or safety catches, and proved to be very useful in combat. The full-auto trigger had also a dedicated safety catch on left side, since 1942 eliminated, rear sight was adjustable up to 500 meters, in MAB 38 and 38A models (38/42 and 38/44 variants had more simple fixed rear sights). Fully automatic or single-shot fire was selectable by the use of two triggers. The MAB 38 had a wooden stock, was about 800 millimeters in length, and weighed about 5 kilograms when loaded, with an effective range of about 200 meters.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105903;New Submachine Gun Design: The Beretta Model 42/43/44;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105903;Despite its undeniable effectiveness, the Beretta Model 38 proved too time-consuming and expensive to produce during wartime. Marengoni designed a simplified model made from sheet steel, in which the cooling jacket and bayonet mount were eliminated, and the separate firing pin mechanism deleted in favor of a fixed firing pin machined on the face of the bolt. Barrel and wooden stock were also shortened to save weight and cost. This new model the Model 38/42 had a fluted barrel to aid cooling and save weight. It also had a slower rate of fire (550 rpm). The Model 38/43, was an intermediate production stage between the 42 and 44 patterns.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105904;New Submachine Gun Design: The Giandoso TZ-45;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105904;The TZ-45 submachine guns was designed by two Italian brothers, Tonon ("Toni") and Zorzoli Giandoso, and was produced by their own small company. All the TZ 45's were issued to R.S.I. (Repubblica Sociale Italiana) units fighting against Italian partisan forces during the civil war in Northern Italy (1944–45), yet it is possible that a few of them ended up serving with Wehrmacht forces engaged in similar operations. After the war, the remaining guns were given to the military of the British and the American forces. It was then evaluated by them, but the general opinion was unfavorable. The gun was emerged from the war with a poor reputation for reliability and the style of the manufacture and finish was not liked.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105905;New Light Machine Gun Design: The Breda Modello 30;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105905;The Breda M30 or Breda 30, was rather unusual for a light machine gun. It was fed from a fixed magazine attached to the right side of the weapon and was loaded using brass or steel 20-round stripper clips. If the magazine or its hinge/latch were damaged the weapon became unusable. It also fired from a closed bolt along with using blowback for its action. The blowback operation was violent, and often resulted in poor primary extraction. During primary extraction, the initial very small rearward movement of the hot expanded cartridge case away from the chamber's walls must be powerful but very slow, if an automatic weapon is to be reliable. Separated cases resulting in jamming of the weapon beyond field clearing, were usually the consequence of poor primary extraction. Breda 30 also inherently lacked good primary extraction in its design and thus utilized a small lubrication device that oiled each cartridge as it entered the chamber. With the dust and sand of the deserts of North Africa, came a combination of premature wear and jamming.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105906;New Light Machine Gun Design: The Breda Modello 38;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105906;The Breda 38 was an Italian tank-pattern machine gun used in World War II. It was able to fit on the available tanks: the Fiat L6/40, the Fiat M11/39, and the Fiat M13/40. It was also adapted as infantry machine gun.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105907;New Heavy Machine Gun Design: The FIAT-Revelli Modello 1914;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105907;The Fiat–Revelli Modello 1914 was an Italian water-cooled medium machine gun produced from 1914 to 1918. It was the standard machine-gun of the Italian Army in the First World War, and was used in limited numbers into the Second World War.  Developed from the Perino Model 1908, it was very similar to the Maxim in appearance (in fact it had the same air-cooling jacket and tripod), even though its internal workings were completely different.  Some sources claim that it had a cartridge-oiling system (like the ones featuring in discussed weapons like the Breda 30), but the weapon manual does not mention its presence, and it seems that only a 1930 version briefly incorporating such a system. It was fed from a 50-round integral magazine divided in ten compartments, each fed from a rifle clip, an arrangement that made it rather slow to reload, prone to malfunction and very uncomfortable in sustained-fire role because of this magazine arrangement.  It was chambered for the 6.5×52mm Mannlicher–Carcano, which eased logistics (as it was the same cartridge of the Carcano rifle) but made it somewhat underpowered compared to higher-calibre weapons, weighed 17 kg (37 lb) (the tripod weighed 21.5 kg (47 lb)) and had a firing rate of 400-500 rpm (rounds-per-minute), rather low for this type of machine gun.  An interesting feature was the presence of select-fire, which allowed for the choice between single shot, "normal" fire and full automatic fire.  It was developed into the Fiat–Revelli Modello 1935.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105908;New Heavy Machine Gun Design: The FIAT-Revelli Modello 1935;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105908;The Modello 35 opted for a more conventional belt feed, air-cooling, rechambering for the 8x59mm RB Breda and, after an unsuccessful attempt, discarding an oil pump to lubricate the bullets as on the Breda 30 light machine gun (but some sources claim that, as the Modello 1914, this weapon still featured this troublesome design, which is not mentioned in any of the technical manuals).  The rechambering to the 8mm calibre and the adoption of a belt feed succeeded in improving both the stopping power and the rate of fire of the machine-gun; however, it reportedly suffered from jammings rather often.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105909;New Mortar Design: The Mortaio da 81/14 Modello 35 81mm;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105909;Mortaio da 81/14 Modello 35 was an Italian World War II infantry mortar. It was the standard weapon of the Italian Army during the war, of typical Brandt-system construction, but relatively lightweight, with good range and considered very successful.  The weapon used two kinds of ammunition, a heavy high-explosive shell weighing 6.86 kg (15.1 lb) and a lighter shell weighing 3.26 kg (7.2 lb) for long distance fire.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105910;New Anti-Tank Rifle Design: The Solothurn S-18/100;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105910;The Solothurn S-18/100 20 mm Anti-Tank Cannon was a Swiss and German anti-tank rifle used during the Second World War. It had a semi-automatic action in a bullpup configuration. As a result of its large, powerful ammunition, the gun had a tremendous recoil, and its size made portability difficult. The feed was either from a five or (more usually) ten-round magazine that was attached horizontally to the left side of the gun. The gun used 20×105mm belted-case ammunition which it shared with the S 18-350 aircraft cannon that was developed from the rifle. A Finnish source gives armour penetration of the gun (probably achieved with the Hungarian APHE-T round, since it was the only type used in Finland) as 20mm at a 60-degree angle at 100-metre distance, decreasing to 16mm at 500 metres.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105911;New Infantry Gun Design: The Cannone da 47/32 M35;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105911;The Cannone da 47/32 M35 was an Austrian artillery piece produced under license in Italy during World War II. It was used both as an infantry gun and an anti-tank gun which it proved to be successful at, especially when equipped with HEAT rounds.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105912;New Infantry Gun Design: The Cannone da 47/32 M39;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105912;The M39 was a variant of the M35 with a revised wheel system making the gun much more transportable than before.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105913;New Infantry Gun Design: The Cannone da 75/32 Modello 37;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105913;The Cannone da 75/32 modello 37 was an Italian field gun used during World War II. (The designation meant that the gun had a 75 mm caliber, the barrel was 32 caliber-lengths long and it was accepted for service in 1937).;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105914;New Medium Field Gun Design: The Cannone da 75/27 Modello 06;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105914;The Cannone da 75/27 modello 06 was a field gun used by Italy during World War I and World War II. It was a license-built copy of the Krupp Kanone M 1906 gun. It had seats for two crewmen attached to the gunshield as was common practice for the period. Captured weapons were designated by the Wehrmacht during World War II as the 7.5 cm Feldkanone 237(i). Special fortress versions were produced as the Cannone da 75/27 modello 06 in Casmatta and in Caverna. These had different carriages suitable for static use.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105915;New Medium Field Gun Design: The Obice da 210/22 Modello 35 210mm;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105915;The Obice da 210/22 modello 35 was an Italian heavy howitzer designed by the Italian Arms and Munitions Technical Service (STAM) and accepted into service by the Italian Army in 1938. A total of 346 were ordered and the gun was produced by Ansaldo at their Pozzuoli factory. However production was slow and approximately 20 were produced by 1942. After Italy surrendered Germany seized as many as they could and a factory in Northern Italy continued to produce guns for the German Army until the end of the war. The carriage was split trail with four wheels which raised from the ground for firing and the gun was trunnioned under the breech to allow for maximum recoil and elevation.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105916;New Medium Howtizer Design: The Obice da 149/19 Modello 37 150mm;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105916;The Obice da 149/19 modello 37 was a heavy howitzer which served with Italy during World War II. It was intended to replace Italy's assortment of World War I-era heavy howitzers, but this was prevented by the prolonged development time and the very slow pace of production. Despite orders totaling 1392 weapons only 147 had been built by September 1942. There were three models, the 37, 41 and 42, differing only in details. The standard tractor was the Trattore SPA TM 40. While an unremarkable design the Germans liked it enough to keep it in production with the designation of 15 cm sFH 404(i) after the Italian surrender in 1943. With the same weight it had superior range compared to the German 15 cm sFH 18. It was used by the Italian army until 1974.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105917;New Heavy Artillery Design: The 150mm Autokanone M. 15/16;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105917;The 15 cm Autokanone M. 15/16 was a heavy field gun used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. Guns turned over to Italy as reparations after World War I were taken into Italian service as the Cannone da 152/37. Austrian and Czech guns were taken into Wehrmacht service after the Anschluss and the occupation of Czechoslovakia as the 15.2 cm K 15/16(t). Italian guns captured after the surrender of Italy in 1943 were known by the Wehrmacht as the 15.2 cm K 410(i). They weren't used much by the Germans, probably because of their unique ammunition, and generally served on coast-defense duties during World War II.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105918;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The Cannone da 47/32 M35;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105918;The Cannone da 47/32 M35 was an Austrian artillery piece produced under license in Italy during World War II. It was used both as an infantry gun and an anti-tank gun which it proved to be successful at, especially when equipped with HEAT (Italian: "Effetto Pronto") rounds.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105919;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The Cannone da 90/53;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105919;The Cannone da 90/53 was an Italian-designed cannon used both in an anti-aircraft role and as an anti-tank gun during World War II. It was one of the most successful anti-aircraft guns to see service during the conflict.  The designation "90/53" meant that the gun had a 90 mm caliber and a barrel 53 caliber-lengths long.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105920;New Anti-Aircraft Gun Design: The Breda Model 35;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105920;The Cannone-Mitragliera da 20/65 modello 35 (Breda), also known as Breda Model 35, was a 20 mm anti-aircraft gun produced by the Societa Italiana Ernesto Breda of Brescia company in Italy and used during World War II. It was designed in 1932 and was adopted by the Italian armed forces in 1935. It was the one of two 20 millimetre calibre anti-aircraft guns used by Italy during World War II, the other being the 20 mm Scotti. Both weapons fired the 20x138mmB cartridge.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105921;New Anti-Aircraft Gun Design: The Cannone da 90/53;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105921;The Cannone da 90/53 was an Italian-designed cannon used both in an anti-aircraft role and as an anti-tank gun during World War II. It was one of the most successful anti-aircraft guns to see service during the conflict.  The designation "90/53" meant that the gun had a 90 mm caliber and a barrel 53 caliber-lengths long.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105922;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The Semovente 75/18;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105922;The Semovente da 75/18 was an Italian self-propelled gun of the Second World War. It was built by mounting the 75 mm Obice da 75/18 modello 34 mountain gun on the chassis of a M13/40 or M14/41 tank. The first 60 were built using the M13/40 chassis and a subsequent 162 were built on the M14/41 chassis from 1941 onwards. The Semovente da 75/18 was intended to be an interim vehicle until the heavier P40 tank could be available.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105923;New Assault Gun Design: The Semovente 47/32;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105923;The Semovente da 47/32 was an Italian self-propelled gun built during World War II. It was created by mounting a Cannone da 47/32 M35 in an open-topped, box-like superstructure on a Fiat L6/40 chassis. Some were built as command tanks with a radio installed instead of the main gun. An 8 mm machine gun disguised as the 47 mm main gun was used on these versions to make them look like a regular Semovente 47/32s. About 300 Semoventi da 47/32 were built from 1941 and onward. The Semovente da 47/32 was the most heavily armed Italian AFV used on the Eastern Front.  While the 47 mm gun was adequate for 1941, by the time the Semovente reached the field it was already outdated and ineffective against enemy medium tanks, and therefore the vehicle wasn't particularly successful.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105924;New Assault Gun Design: The Semovente 75/46;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105924;The Semovente da 75/46 was an Italian self-propelled gun used during World War II. It was built by mounting a 75 mm L46 gun on the chassis of a M15/42 tank. After the Armistice of Cassibile, control of the Ansaldo factories fell under German control. The Germans ordered the production of a modified version of the M 42L and a 75/46 was the gun of choice. The resulting vehicle was named the M 42T da 75/46 (the T signified Tedesco or German). Only a limited number were produced and these were used exclusively by the Germans. Only about 15 were ever made.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105925;New Assault Gun Design: The Semovente 75/34;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105925;The Semovente da 75/34 was an Italian self-propelled gun developed and used during World War II. It was a 75 mm L/34 gun mounted on a M15/42 tank chassis. It saw action during the defence of Rome in 1943 and later served with the Germans in Northern Italy and the Balkans. 141 were produced during the war.  After the success of the Semovente da 75/18, it was decided to build a self-propelled gun with a better gun, to improve its anti-tank capability (which on the former was given by the use of HEAT shells); some prototypes were built which replaced the Obice da 75/18 with a 75 mm L/32 field gun on the M14/41 tank chassis.Only in spring 1943 did production begin, with the 75 mm L/34 gun (the same as on the Carro Armato P 40) and the chassis used was that of the M15/42 tank. Some sixty were built before the Italian armistice in September 1943.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105926;New Light Tank Design: The L3/33 (CV-33);;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105926;The Carro Veloce CV-33 or L3/33 was a tankette originally built in 1933 and used by the Italian Army before and during World War II. It was based on the imported British Carden Loyd tankette (also license-built by Italy as the CV-29). Many CV-33s were retrofitted to meet the specifications of the CV-35 in 1935. In 1938, the CV-33 was renamed the "L3/33" while the CV-35s became known as "L3/35s."  The original CV-33 carried a two-man crew protected by 12 mm of welded armour and was armed with a single 6.5 mm machine gun.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105927;New Light Tank Design: The Fiat L5/30;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105927;The Fiat 3000 was the first tank to be produced in series in Italy. It was to be the standard tank of the emerging Italian armored units after World War I. The 3000 was based on the French Renault FT.  Although 1,400 units were ordered, with deliveries to begin in May 1919, the end of the war caused the original order to be canceled and only 100 were delivered. The first Fiat 3000s entered service in 1921 and were officially designated as the carro d'assalto Fiat 3000, Mod. 21. ("Fiat 3000 assault tank, Model 21"). Tests of the Model 21 revealed that the armament, consisting of two 6.5 mm machine guns, was inadequate, and adoption of a 37 mm gun as main armament was urged.  The up-gunned version of the 3000, armed with a 37/40 gun, was tested in 1929 and was officially adopted in 1930 with the designation of carro d'assalto Fiat 3000, Mod. 30. The Model 30, in addition to its improved armament, also differed from the Model 21 in that it had a more powerful engine, improved suspension, different engine compartment silhouette, and the external stores were stowed differently. Some Model 30s were also produced with two 6.5 mm machine guns as main armament, as on the Model 21, in lieu of the 37 mm gun. A limited number of Model 21 vehicles were exported to Albania, Latvia, Hungary, and Abyssinia (Ethiopia) prior to 1930.  The designations of these tanks were changed prior to the outbreak of World War II, in accordance with the identification system that was adopted throughout the war by the Italians. The Model 21 was redesignated L5/21, and the Model 30 was redesignated L5/30.  The Fiat 3000 (Model 21) was first used in action in February 1926 in Libya, and subsequently also saw action against the Ethiopians in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War in 1935. The Italians did not employ any of these tanks in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, however. With Italy's entry into World War II in June 1940, a limited number of Fiat 3000s still in service with the Italian Army were employed operationally on the Greek-Albanian front. They were also among the last Italian tanks to oppose the Allies, as in July 1943, when the Allies landed in Sicily, two Italian tank companies on the island were still equipped with the 3000.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105928;New Light Tank Design: The Carro Armato L6/40;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105928;The Fiat L6/40 was a light tank used by the Italian army from 1940 through World War II. It was designed by Fiat-Ansaldo as an export product, and was adopted by the Italian Army when officials learned of the design and expressed interest. It was the main tank employed by the Italian forces fighting on the Eastern Front alongside the L6/40-based Semovente 47/32 self-propelled gun. L6/40s were also used in the North African campaign.  The official Italian designation was Carro Armato ("armored tank") L6/40. This designation means: "L" for Leggero, followed by the weight in tons (6) and the year of adoption (1940).;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105929;New Medium Tank Design: The Fiat Carro Armato;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105929;The Fiat-Ansaldo M11/39 was an Italian medium tank first produced prior to World War II. The M11/39 saw service in Africa and Italy (1939–1944). The official Italian designation was Carro Armato (armoured vehicle) M11/39. The designation for the M11/39 is as follows: "M" for Medio, followed by the weight in tonnes (11) and the year of adoption (1939).  The M11/39 was developed as a "breakthrough tank" (Carro di Rottura). The design of the M11/39 was influenced by the British Vickers 6-Ton. This influence is reflected particularly in the track and suspension design. A novelty of the design was the placement of the final reduction gears inside the front-mounted drive sprockets, eliminating the need for enlarged final drive housings in the bow armour. Service use of the M11/39 was short due to several deficiencies in its design, particularly the placement of the main 37 mm gun in the hull. The design concept was to use the main gun against other tanks and to defend the tank with the turret armament. The gun was in a fixed position with traverse restricted to 15 degrees to port and starboard. Dual 8 mm machine guns were housed in a small rotating one-man turret, with manual controls.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105930;New Medium Tank Destroyer Design: The Semovente 105/25;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105930;The Semovente da 105/25 was an Italian tank destroyer in use during World War II. It was constructed by mounting a 105 mm gun that was 25 calibres long (hence the name) in a widened chassis from a M15/42 tank. Thirty were built by Fiat-Ansaldo and delivered in 1943 before the Armistice of Cassibile in September that year. After the armistice the German forces took them over and used them under the designation Sturmgeschütz M43 mit 105/25 853(i) as well as producing 60 additional Semoventi da 105/25.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105931;New Medium Tank Destroyer Design: The Semovente 90/53;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105931;The Semovente da 90/53 was a heavy Italian self-propelled gun and tank destroyer, used by the Italian and German Armies during World War II.  The Semovente da 90/53 was created by mounting a 90 mm Cannone da 90/53 anti-aircraft gun on top of an enlarged chassis of a M14/41 tank. Only 30 of these vehicles were produced, all in 1942. This low production was due to Italy's limited industrial capability at the time, as well as high demand for the 90 mm gun for regular anti-aircraft duties.  The Semovente da 90/53 was primarily developed in response to demands by Italian forces on the Eastern Front for a vehicle-mounted anti-tank weapon that could take on Soviet T-34 and KV tanks. Italian armoured forces on the Eastern Front were equipped only with the L6/40 tank and Semovente 47/32 self-propelled gun; neither of these had the firepower to cope with the Soviet medium and heavy tanks. However, no Semoventi da 90/53 were ever sent to the Eastern Front.  The major drawback of the Semovente da 90/53, as with many self-propelled gun types of World War II, was the open top and rear of the gun compartment, which left the gun crew exposed to shrapnel and small arms fire. In addition, the Semovente da 90/53 had little or no armour in most areas. Because these vehicles were designed to operate far enough away from enemy vehicles to not be subject to incoming fire, this was initially not considered a problem. The small ammunition capacity of the vehicle was also a problem, only six rounds could be carried. This necessitated the creation of special ammunition carriers out of Fiat L6/40 tanks, one accompanying each Semovente da 90/53 in the field. The L6 ammunition carrier itself carried 26 rounds along with an additional 40 rounds in a towed trailer. It fired Effetto Pronto, or HEAT rounds, which could pierce 70 mm armour plating at a range of 2,200 meters.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105932;New Advanced Semi-Automatic Rifle Design: The Beretta Model 59 (BM59);;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105932;The Beretta BM59 is an Italian-made rifle based on the M1 Garand rifle, but chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO, and modified to use a detachable magazine. Later revisions incorporated other features common to more modern rifles.  After World War II, Italy adopted the US-designed M1 Garand rifle in .30-06 Springfield (7.62x63mm) and also manufactured it under license. This semi-automatic rifle proved itself well during World War II, but in the late 1950s it was considered outdated and obsolete and the Italian military also wanted a new rifle chambered for the NATO-standard 7.62x51mm round.  To meet these requirements, Beretta designed the BM59, which was essentially a rechambered M1 fitted with a removable 20-round magazine, folding bipod and a combined flash suppressor/rifle grenade launcher. The BM59 is capable of selective fire.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105933;New Advanced Submachine Gun Design: The Beretta Modello 12;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105933;The Beretta Model 12 is a 9x19mm Parabellum caliber submachine gun designed by Beretta. The production started in 1962, the first users were the Italian Carabinieri and the Italian State Police even though in limited number, only in 1978 it was widely issued replacing the old Beretta MAB. In 1962 the Italian Army bought a limited number of Franchi LF57 submachine gun, judged better than the M12 but never issued to the troops, and only in 1992 the M12S2 variant was introduced also if in very limited number. The Italian Air Force, instead, bought a large number of M12S and M12S2 for the airport security units.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105934;New Advanced Submachine Gun Design: The Franchi LF-57;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105934;The Franchi LF57 is an Italian made pressed-metal submachine gun. A small number were made for the Italian Navy in the 1960s, but few others ordered it. The LF57 uses a recessed bolt head similar to the Beretta Model 12's as a method of reducing the weapon's length, although on the LF57 the bolt's mass is carried above the barrel rather than around it. This allows manufacture to be simplified to a degree. Most parts are made of stampings and pressings, and the two sides of the gun are one piece each, joined by a long seam. Dismantling the weapon is very simple, such as the barrel, which is held on by one single barrel nut. The tubular butt folds to the right side of the receiver, and the pistol grip is made entirely of steel. The sights are simple fixtures on the top of the barrel. Also it was rapidly known as the "Dead Squirrel" due to its low ammunition capacity.;;;;;;;;;;x
