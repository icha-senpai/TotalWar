EVTNAME9105700;New Rifle Design: The Modele 1886 'Lebel' Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105700;The Lebel Model 1886 rifle is also known as the 'Fusil Mle 1886 M93', after a bolt modification was added in 1893. It is an 8 mm bolt action infantry rifle that entered service in the French Army in 1887. It is a repeating rifle that can hold eight rounds in its forestock tube magazine, one round in the transporter plus one round in the chamber. The Lebel rifle has the distinction of being the first military firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition.  Featuring an oversized bolt with front locking lugs and a massive receiver, the Lebel rifle was a durable design capable of long range performance. In spite of early obsolete features, such as its tube magazine and the shape of 8mm Lebel rimmed ammunition, the Lebel rifle remained the basic weapon of French line infantry during World War I (1914–1918). Altogether, 3.45 million Lebel rifles were produced by the three French state factories between 1887 and 1916.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105701;New Rifle Design: The MAS 36 Bolt Action Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105701;The MAS Modele 36 was a military bolt action rifle. First adopted in 1936 by France and intended to replace the Berthier and Lebel series of service rifles, it saw service long past the World War II period. It was manufactured by Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Etienne (MAS), one of several government-owned arms factories in France. Because production was initiated late in 1937, not enough MAS-36 rifles were available to arm French infantry when the war broke out in September 1939. Mass production finally caught up after World War II and MAS-36 rifles became widely used in service during the First Indochina War, the Algerian War and the Suez Crisis. Altogether, about 1.1 million MAS-36 rifles had been manufactured when production ceased in 1952.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105702;New Rifle Design: The Fusil Automatique Model 1917;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105702;The Fusil Automatique Modele 1917 (also called the RSC M1917) was a semi-automatic, gas-operated, infantry rifle that the French Army placed in service during the latter part (1918) of World War I. It was chambered in then-standard 8mm Lebel, the rimmed cartridge used in other French Army infantry weapons of the time. Altogether, MAT (Manufacture d'Armes de Tulle) had manufactured 86,000 RSC M1917 rifles when their production run ended in late November 1918.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105703;New Submachinegun Design: The MAS 38 Submachinegun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105703;The MAS-38 was a French submachine gun designed prior to the Second World War and used by French and German forces. It derived from a small arms development program that took place between 1918 and 1922 under the control of the Service Technique de l'Armement. A submachine gun, a light machine gun and a semi automatic rifle were developed to replace all the existing small arms. Budgetary constraints due to choices like building the Maginot Line led to the delay of adoption of these new arms except for the LMG 1924.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105704;New Light Machine Gun Design: The Fusil Modele 1915 CSRG Light Machine Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105704;The Chauchat, named after its main contributor Colonel Louis Chauchat, was the standard machine rifle or light machine gun of the French Army during World War I (1914–18). Its official designation was 'Fusil Mitrailleur Modele 1915 CSRG'.  Beginning in June 1916, it was placed into regular service with French infantry, where the troops called it the FM Chauchat. The Chauchat machine rifle in 8mm Lebel was also extensively used in 1917–18 by the American Expeditionary Forces (A.E.F), where it was officially designated as the 'Automatic Rifle, Model 1915 (Chauchat)'. A total of 262,000 Chauchat machine rifles were manufactured between December 1915 and November 1918, including 244,000 chambered for the 8mm Lebel service cartridge, making it the most widely manufactured automatic weapon of World War I. The armies of eight other nations – Belgium, Finland, Greece, Italy, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Serbia – also used the Chauchat machine rifle in fairly large numbers during and after World War I. The Chauchat machine rifle was one of the first light, automatic rifle-caliber weapons designed to be carried and fired by a single operator and an assistant, without a heavy tripod or a team of gunners. It set a precedent for several subsequent 20th-century firearm projects, being a portable, yet full-power automatic weapon built inexpensively and in very large numbers. The Chauchat combined a pistol grip, an in-line stock, a detachable magazine, and a selective fire capability in a compact package of manageable weight (20 pounds) for a single soldier. Furthermore, it could be routinely fired from the hip and while walking (marching fire).;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105705;New Light Machine Gun Design: The Chatellerault Model 1929 Light Machine Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105705;The Fusil-mitrailleur Modele 1924 M29 was the standard light machine gun of the French Army from 1925 until the 1960s and was in use until 2000-2006 with the National Gendarmerie. It fires the French 7.5×54mm round which is equivalent in ballistics and striking power to the later 7.62×51mm NATO (.308 Winchester) round. A robust and reliable weapon partly derived from the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) action, the FM 1924 M29 soldiered on, practically without interruptions, for more than 50 years.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105706;New Heavy Machine Gun Design: The Hotchkiss Modele 1914 Heavy Machine Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105706;The Hotchkiss machine gun, a sturdy and reliable weapon, remained in active service with the French army until the early 1940s. By the end of 1918, 47,000 Hotchkiss machine guns had already been delivered to the French army alone. If one includes all the international sales, the grand total of all Hotchkiss machine guns sold by the manufacturer in various calibers is well in excess of 100,000 units.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105707;New Mortar Design: The Brandt Modele 1935 60mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105707;The Brandt Mle 1935 60-mm mortar was a company-level indirect-fire weapon of the French army during the Second World War. Designed by Edgar Brandt, it was copied by other countries, such as the United States and China, as well as purchased and built by Romania. The mortar continued to be used by France after the war until at least the 1960s.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105708;New Mortar Design: The Brandt Modele 27/31 81mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105708;The Brandt mle 27/31 mortar was a regulation weapon of the French army during the Second World War. Designed by Edgar Brandt, it was a refinement of the Stokes mortar. The Brandt mortar was highly influential, being licensed built or copied by numerous countries.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105709;New Infantry Gun Design: The Canon de 75 Modele 1897 Infantry Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105709;The French 75 mm field gun was a quick-firing field artillery piece adopted in March 1898. It was commonly known as the French 75, simply the 75 and Soixante-Quinze. Initially, the French 75 had been designed as an anti-personnel weapon system for delivering large volumes of time-fused shrapnel shells on enemy troops advancing in the open. After 1915 and the onset of trench warfare, other types of battlefield missions demanding impact-detonated high-explosive shells prevailed. By 1918 the 75s became the main agents of delivery for toxic gas shells. The 75s also became widely used as truck mounted anti-aircraft artillery. They were also the main armament of the Saint-Chamond tank in 1918. The French 75 is widely regarded as the first modern artillery piece. It was the first field gun to include a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism, which kept the gun's trail and wheels perfectly still during the firing sequence. Since it did not need to be re-aimed after each shot, the crew could fire as soon as the barrel returned to its resting position. In typical use, the French 75 could deliver fifteen rounds per minute on its target, either shrapnel or melinite high-explosive, up to about 5 miles (8,500 m) away. Its firing rate could even reach close to 30 rounds per minute, albeit only for a very short time and with a highly experienced crew. At the opening of World War I, in 1914, the French Army had about 4,000 of these field guns in service. By the end of the war about 12,000 had been produced. It was also in service with the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), which had been supplied with about 2,000 French 75 field guns. Several thousand were still in use in the French Army at the opening of World War II, updated with new wheels and tires to allow towing by trucks rather than by horses. The French 75 set the pattern for almost all early-20th century field pieces, with guns of mostly 75 mm forming the basis of many field artillery units into the early stages of World War II.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105710;New Infantry Gun Design: The Canon de 105 court Modele 1935 B Infantry Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105710;The Canon de 105 court modele 1935 B was a French howitzer used in World War II. It was designed by the State Arsenal at Bourges to replace the Canon de 105 court mle 1934 Schneider. Some 610 were originally ordered, although production was terminated in 1939 in favor of anti-tank guns. Only some 232 were in service when the German attacked in May 1940. Captured weapons were used by the German Heer as the 10.5 cm leFH 325(f) and assigned to training and second-line occupation units.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105711;New Howitzer Design: The Canon de 155 C Modele 1917 Schneider Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105711;The Canon de 155 C modele 1917 Schneider, often abbreviated as the C17S, was a French howitzer designed by Schneider. It was essentially the Canon de 155 C modele 1915 Schneider fitted with a different breech to use bagged propellant rather than the cartridge cases used by the older howitzer. It was used by France, Italy, Russian Empire, Belgium and the United States from 1917 during World War I and was widely exported after the war. Surviving weapons were in service with France, Poland, Greece, Italy, Belgium, the United States and Finland during World War II. Captured weapons were used by the Germans for their 2nd-line artillery and coast defense units.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105712;New Heavy Mortar Design: The Mortier de 280 Modele 1914 Schneider Heavy Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105712;The Mortier de 280 mle 1914 Schneider was a siege howitzer of conventional design for its time. It used a hydro-pneumatic system to absorb the recoil forces generated when firing. The box carriage was mounted on a firing platform and only allowed 20 degrees of traverse. One unusual feature was the presence of two large steel pads mounted on swinging outriggers at the rear of the firing platform, possibly to reduce movement of the platform when firing at low angles. A pit needed to be dug underneath the breech for very high-angle firing. It had an interrupted-screw breech, probably with a deBange obturator, and used bagged propellant. Shells were loaded onto the ammunition trolley that ran on rails behind the breech using the on-board crane and the trolley was moved adjacent to the breech after it had been brought back to the proper angle for loading. It had a crew of 12 men and fired a 205 kilograms (452 lb) high-explosive shell to a range of 10,950 metres (11,980 yd). It was dismantled into four loads, barrel, cradle, carriage and firing platform, for transport and carried on 4 horse-drawn carts.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105713;New Heavy Artillery Design: The Canon de 155 (GPF) Mle.1917 155mm Heavy Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105713;The gun was designed during World War I by Colonel Louis Filloux to meet France's urgent need for modern heavy artillery, and became the standard heavy field gun of the French Army from 1917 until World War II.  It was also manufactured in the USA from 1917, after the US switched to metric artillery based on French patterns. It was used by the United States Army and United States Marine Corps as their primary heavy artillery gun under the designation 155 mm Gun M1917 or M1918 until 1942, when it was gradually replaced by the 155 mm M1A1 'Long Tom'. US Army forces in the Far East (USAFFE) such as the 301st FA Regiment (Philippine Army) and the 86th FA Regiment (Philippine Scouts), and also US Coast Artillery units (91st and 92nd CA Regiments, Philippine Scouts) used this artillery piece against the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in 1941-42. Some of the guns were originally emplaced in "Panama Mounts" on Corregidor, Caballo, and Carabao islands on the entrance of Manila Bay. A number of them were removed from their emplacements and used as "roving batteries" and gave effective counterbattery fire. The gun was later mounted on a self-propelled mount as the M12 Gun Motor Carriage and saw action in 1944-45.  During World War II, some US-made guns were used for coast defence of US and allied territories, such as Australia, typically on "Panama" mountings - circular concrete platforms with a raised centre section, with the carriage tyres pivoting around the centre section and the split trails spread out on rails at the platform's edge.  In 1940, France fielded 450 of these guns. Many of them were captured and used by Germany for the rest of the war. In German service it was known as the 15.5 cm K 418(f), it served with heavy artillery battalions and on coastal defense duties. A battery of six of these guns were the cause of the actions at Pointe du Hoc in June 1944.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105714;New Anti-Tank Design: The 25mm Hotchkiss Anti-Tank Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105714;By the early 1920s the French Army had come to the realization that the armour-piercing capability of the 37 mm TRP infantry gun would be insufficient against modern tanks. In 1926 Hotchkiss proposed a 25mm in-house design that was eventually accepted for service in 1934, under the designation canon de 25 mm semi-automatique modele 1934 (generally shortened to canon de 25) . At the outbreak of World War II, it was the main anti-tank weapon of the French infantry. By May 1940, there were reported to be 6,000 in service with the French Army, although some formations were still waiting for their full allocation. In action in the Battle of France in 1940, it was found that the projectile was too small to be very effective against German tanks, especially at longer ranges. It remained a useful weapon against armoured cars and other light armoured vehicles.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105715;New Anti-Tank Design: The AC 37 Anti-Tank Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105715;The AC 37 was a French anti-tank gun of 37mm caliber, developed by the Ateliers de Puteaux. It was principally used in the ouvrages and casemates of the Maginot Line in the late 1930s. It was frequently paired with a model JM twin machine gun.  The AC 37 was superseded by the AC 47 anti-tank gun.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105716;New Anti-Tank Design: The 47mm APX Anti-Tank Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105716;In the 1930s the French artillery sought a replacement for the derivatives of the 75 mm mle 1897 field gun it used in the anti-tank role. Despite having a decent anti-armour capability, the venerable soixante-quinze was heavy and was much harder to conceal than the smaller high-velocity, small calibre anti-tank weapons of modern design. The chosen weapon was a design of the state-owned arsenal Atelier de Puteaux ("Puteaux workshop", abbreviated to APX), and was designated as canon de 47mm semi-automatique mle 1937. It was a very efficient weapon, especially given the thin armour of the German tanks of the time. Unfortunately for France, the 47mm SA 37 was still a rare weapon at the time of the Battle of France.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105717;New Anti-Air Design: The Tarasque Type 53 T2 Anti-Air Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105717;The Tarasque Type 53 T2 is a 20 mm anti-aircraft gun adopted by the French Army. The Tarasque is based on the M693 F1 20 mm auto-cannon and mounted on a light two-wheeled trailer that can be towed by a jeep and brought into action in only 20 seconds. The Tarasque can be used against both aerial and ground targets and there is a 5x magnification telescopic sight for use against ground targets and a 1x magnification sight for anti-aircraft use. The Tarasque carriage is powered by an auxiliary hydraulic pump which provides power for both traverse and elevation. As a backup the Tarasque can also be powered manually if the hydraulic system fails.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105718;New Anti-Air Design: The Canon de 75 CVM 1940 Schneider Anti-Air Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105718;The Canon de 75 contre avion modele 1940 Schneider was a French piece of 75 mm artillery of the Second World War, designed and manufactured by Schneider et Cie in Le Creusot.  The gun was designed from 1928, evolving from the design of the Canon de 75 modele 1897. The anti-air mounting went into service in the mid-30s, and by May 1940, 75mm guns of models 1897 and 1928 were mounted as anti-aircraft artillery. These guns were used by both the French Army and the French Navy.  With a x6 scope, the Canon anti-aerien de 75mm modele 1939 had anti-armour capabilities, in spite of the lack of armour-piercing ammunition.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105719;New Infantry Tank Design: The Char B1;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105719;The Char B1 was a specialised heavy break-through vehicle, originally conceived as a self-propelled gun with a 75 mm howitzer in the hull, later a 47 mm gun in a turret was added, to allow it to function also as a Char de Bataille, a "battle tank" fighting enemy armour, equipping the armoured divisions of the Infantry Arm. Starting in the early twenties, its development and production were repeatedly delayed, resulting in a vehicle that was both technologically complex and expensive, and already obsolescent when real mass-production of a derived version, the Char B1 "bis", started in the late thirties. Although a second uparmoured version, the Char B1 "ter", was developed, only two prototypes were built.  Among the most powerfully armed and armoured tanks of its day, the type was very effective in direct confrontations with German armour in 1940 during the Battle of France, but slow speed and high fuel consumption made it ill-adapted to the war of movement then being fought. After the defeat of France captured Char B1 (bis) would be used by Germany, with some rebuilt as flamethrowers or mechanised artillery.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105720;New Cavalry Tank Design: The SOMUA S35;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105720;The SOMUA S35 was a French Cavalry tank of the Second World War. Built from 1936 until 1940 to equip the armoured divisions of the Cavalry, it was for its time a relatively agile medium-weight tank, superior in armour and armament to both its French and foreign competitors, such as the contemporary versions of the German Panzerkampfwagen III. It was constructed from well-sloped, mainly cast, armour sections, that however made it expensive to produce and time-consuming to maintain.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105721;New Cavalry Tank Design: The Char G1;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105721;The Char G1 was a French replacement project for the Char D2 medium tank. Several prototypes from different companies were developed since 1936, but not a single one had been fully completed at the time of the Fall of France in 1940. The projects represented some of the most advanced French tank design of the period and finally envisaged a type that would have been roughly equal in armament and mobility to later World War II standard tanks of other nations, such as the Soviet T-34 and the American M4 Sherman, but possessing several novel features, such as gun stabilisation, a semi-automatic loader and an optical rangefinder.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105722;New Heavy Tank Design: The ARL 44;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105722;The ARL 44 clearly shows that it is based on earlier French heavy tank design. The hull is long, over nine metres, but relatively narrow, just as a vehicle meant to cross wide trenches. The covered suspension, with its many small road wheels, that had already been outdated in the thirties, is the most obvious sign of its basic Char B1 ancestry; it is in essence identical to that of the Char B1 ter. The type has often been compared to the many "Super Char B" projects from before the war. Its speed is likewise limited, the lowest of any fifty ton tank built after the war. This was also partly due to the lack of a sufficiently strong engine; it had originally been intended to compensate for this by using a more efficient petro-electrical transmission. This kind of transmission has as a major drawback that it very easily overheats and the ARL 44 as a result was fitted with an impressive and complex array of ventilators and cooling ducts; the engine deck was made to extend behind the track to accommodate them all. The hull glacis plate is 120mm thick and reclined at about 45 degrees, giving a line-of-sight thickness in the horizontal plane of about 170 mm. This made the ARL 44 the most heavily armoured French tank until the Leclerc. Within the glacis, low on the right side, a 7.5mm machine-gun is fitted in a fixed position.  The turret was the most modern looking part, it was also an obvious makeshift solution, somewhat crudely welded together, made necessary by the simple fact Schneider as yet couldn't produce complete cast turrets large enough to hold a 90 mm gun. The turret front, however, was a cast section. As the turret was positioned near the middle of the tank, even when pointing to the back the gun would have a large overhang; to facilitate transport it was therefore made retractable into the turret. The turret was rotated by a Simca 5 engine.  In all, the ARL 44 was an unsatisfactory interim design, afterwards often called the "Transitional Tank", the main function of which was to provide experience in building heavier vehicles. The main lesson learned for many engineers was that it was unwise to construct too-heavy types, and this opinion was reinforced by the failure of the tank project to which the ARL 44 formed the transition: the much more ambitious heavy AMX 50. Only after a gap of sixteen years would France, in 1966, again build a main battle tank, the AMX 30.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105723;New Light Tank Design: The FCM 36;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105723;The FCM 36 or Char leger Modele 1936 FCM, was a light infantry tank that was designed for the French Army prior to World War II. It had a crew of two and was equipped with a short 37 mm main armament and a 7.5 mm coaxial machine gun. Power was provided by a diesel engine.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105724;New Light Tank Design: The Hotchkiss H35;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105724;The Hotchkiss H35 or Char leger modele 1935 H was a French light tank developed prior to World War II. Despite having been designed from 1933 as a rather slow but well-armoured light infantry support tank, the type was initially rejected by the French Infantry because it proved difficult to steer while driving cross-country, and was instead adopted in 1936 by the French Cavalry.  From 1938 an improved version was produced with a stronger engine, the Char leger modele 1935 H modifie 39, which from 1940 was also fitted with a longer, more powerful 37 mm gun. It was intended to make this improved variant the standard light tank, with at least four thousand produced to equip new armoured divisions of both the Cavalry and the Infantry, but due to the defeat of France in June 1940 total production of both subtypes was limited to about 1200 vehicles.  For the remainder of the war Germany and its allies would use captured Hotchkiss tanks in several modifications.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105725;New Light Tank Design: The Renault R40;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105725;The Renault R40 or Char leger modele 1935 R modifie 1939 was a French light infantry tank that was used early in World War II, an improvement of the Renault R35, of which it is often considered a variant.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105726;New Heavy Tank Design: The Char D2;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105726;The Char D2 was a French tank of the interwar period.  In 1930, at a time the Char D1 had not even entered production, the Renault company agreed to build a better armoured version called the Char D2. By using welded armour plate instead of the dated riveted design of the D1 this would be lighter than a simple version of the D1 made with thicker plating. The tank should be able to serve as an alternative in the role of battle tank for the heavy Char B1, should the latter be forbidden by treaty. The failure of the armament limitation talks resulted in a severe reduction of the projected manufacture, now in the form of an interim tank. Organisational difficulties with Renault caused the actual production of a first series of fifty to be delayed to the years 1936 and 1937. A second series of fifty was ordered in 1938, despite indications that the type was mechanically unreliable, as a possible cheaper addition to the expensive Char B1, to be able to raise more armoured divisions of the Infantry Arm. Due to Renault's financial problems, this second, partially improved version, was only realised in early 1940, bringing total production to a hundred.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105727;New Advanced Submachinegun Design: The MAT-49 Submachinegun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105727;The MAT-49 was a submachine gun which was developed by French arms factory Manufacture Nationale d'Armes de Tulle (MAT) for use by the French Army and was first produced in 1949.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105728;New Advanced Light Machine Gun Design: The AAT-52 GPMG;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105728;The AA-52, also known as "La Nana", is one of the first French-produced guns of the post–World War II era. It was manufactured by the French government-owned Manufacture d'armes de Saint-Etienne (MAS) company. The AA-52 is still used today as a vehicle-mounted weapon due to large quantities in service, but has been replaced in the helicopter role by the Belgian FN MAG, starting with the EC 725 Caracal of the special operations units and the Air Force search and rescue teams. The AA-52 had been largely phased out for infantry use in favour of the lighter FN Minimi. The AA-52 is still in use in Afghanistan.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105729;New Semi-Automatic Rifle Design: The MAS 49 Semi-Automatic Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105729;The MAS-49 is a French semi-automatic rifle that replaced various bolt action rifles as the French service rifle in 1949. It was designed and manufactured by the government-owned MAS arms factory. The MAS-49 semi-automatic rifle was produced in limited quantities (20,600 units), whereas the shorter and lighter variant, the MAS-49/56, was mass manufactured (275,240 units) and issued to all branches of the French military. Overall, the MAS-49 and 49/56 rifles gained the reputation of being accurate, reliable and easy to maintain in adverse environments. All the MAS-49 and 49/56 rifles feature a rail on the left side of their receivers to accommodate a designated rifle scope. The MAS-49 and MAS-49/56 were replaced as French service rifles by the FAMAS assault rifle in 1979.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105730;New Anti-Tank Grenade Design: The APAV 40 40mm Anti-Tank Grenade;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105730;The APAV 40 was a dual role anti-personnel/anti-tank grenade used by the French developed in 1960.  It could be used to dislodge dug-in infantry and was an effective anti-tank weapon against light armor.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105731;New Armored Personnel Carrier Design: The AMX VCI Infantry Combat Vehicle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105731;The AMX-VCI is one of the many variants of the French AMX-13 light tank. It was the front line APC of the French Army until replaced by the AMX-10P. It is still used by some countries, for example Mexico, where it goes under the name of DNC-1 and is armed with a 20mm cannon.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105732;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The AMX-105 SP Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105732;The AMX-105 SPG was nothing more than a self-propelled gun conversion of the successful French AMX-13 Light Tank.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105733;New Light Tank Design: The AMX-13 Light Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105733;The AMX-13 is a French light tank produced from 1953 to 1985. It served with the French Army, as the Char 13t-75 Modele 51, and was exported to more than 25 other nations. Named after its initial weight of 13 tonnes, and featuring a tough and reliable chassis, it was fitted with an oscillating turret built by GIAT Industries (now Nexter) with revolver type magazines, which were also used on the Austrian SK-105 Kurassier. Including prototypes and export versions, there are over a hundred variants including self-propelled guns, anti-aircraft systems, APCs, and ATGM versions.

EVTNAME9105734;New Heavy Tank Design: The AMX-50 Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105734;The AMX 50 or AMX-50 was a French heavy tank designed in the immediate post Second World War period. It was proposed as, in succession, the French medium, heavy, and main battle tank and incorporated many advanced features. However, it was to suffer cancellation in the late 1950s due to unfavourable economic and political circumstances combined with delays in development.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105735;New Main Battle Tank Design: The AMX-30 Main Battle Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105735;The AMX-30 is a main battle tank designed by GIAT and first delivered to the French Army in 1966. The first five tanks were issued to the 501st Regiment de Chars de Combat (Tank Regiment) in August of that year. The production version of the AMX-30 weighed 36 metric tons (40 short tons), and sacrificed protection for increased mobility. The French believed that it would have required too much armour to protect against the latest anti-tank threats, thereby reducing the tank's maneuverability. Protection, instead, was provided by the speed and the compact dimensions of the vehicle, including a height of 2.28 metres. It had a 105-millimetre (4.1 in) cannon, firing an advanced high explosive anti-tank warhead known as the Obus G. The Obus G used an outer shell, separated from the main charge by ball bearings, to allow the round to be spin stabilized by the gun without affecting the warhead inside. Mobility was provided by the 720 horsepower (540 kW) HS-110 diesel engine, although the troublesome transmission adversely affected the tank's performance.;;;;;;;;;;x
