EVTNAME9106700;New Anti-Tank Rifle Design: The Lahti L-39;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106700;The Lahti L-39 is a Finnish 20mm anti-tank rifle used during the Second World War. It had excellent accuracy, penetration and range, but its size made transportation difficult. It was nicknamed "Norsupyssy" ("Elephant Gun"), and as tanks developed armour too thick for the Lahti to penetrate its uses switched to long range sniping, tank harassment and with the L-39/44 fully automatic variant, an improvised anti-aircraft weapon.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106701;New Submachine Gun Design: The KP/-31 Submachine Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106701;The Suomi KP/-31 was a submachine gun (SMG) of Finnish design used during World War II. It was a descendant of the M-22 prototype and the KP/-26 production model, which was revealed to the public in 1925. The Suomi-konepistooli KP/-31 is often abbreviated to Suomi KP.  The Suomi KP/-31 is regarded by many as one of the most successful submachine guns of World War II, also the soon developed 71-round drum magazine was later copied and adopted by the Soviets for their PPD-40 and PPSh-41 submachine guns. The accuracy of the Suomi was superior to that of the mass-produced PPSh-41, thanks in part to a noticeably longer barrel, with the same rate of fire and the equally large magazine capacity. The major disadvantage of the Suomi KP/-31 was its high production cost.;;;;;;;;;;x
