EVTNAME9107500;New Bolt-Action Rifle Design: The Karabinek wz. 1929;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9107500;The Karabinek wz.29 was a Polish bolt-action short rifle based on the German Kar98AZ. Identifying attributes include a 98/05 style mast bayonet lug ending directly beneath the front sight and winged protective ears to either side of the front sight blade. Cavalry models featured a turned-down bolt handle, and early versions had a stacking hook near the end of the stock on the right side.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9107501;New Bolt-Action Rifle Design: The Kb wz. 98a;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9107501;Karabin wzor 98a (Kb wz.98a) was a Polish bolt-action rifle based on the German Gewehr 98.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9107502;New Semi-Automatic Rifle Design: The Kbsp wz. 1938M;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9107502;The Karabin samopowtarzalny wzor 38M was a Polish 7.9 mm semi-automatic rifle used by the Polish Army during the Invasion of Poland of 1939.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9107503;New Submachine Gun Design: The Mors SMG;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9107503;Pistolet maszynowy wz. 39 Mors (Mors is Latin for death, Polish for walrus) was a Polish submachine gun designed by Piotr Wilniewczyc and Jan Skrzypiński between 1936 and 1938. It was to have become the standard submachine gun of the Polish Army some time in the 1940s. However, its production was halted by the 1939 Invasion of Poland and World War II.  The design was generally modelled after the German ERMA EMP-35. Common features of both was a wooden butt and forward pistol grip, the most noticeable difference was the magazine extending downwards in the Mors rather than to the left side of the ERMA. The SMG was to be issued to some of the infantry units, as well as to tank crews and boarding parties of the Polish Navy and armoured trains. Later the idea of equipping tank crews was abandoned due to its size. After extensive tests, the construction proved to be reliable and durable. Some Polish non commissioned officer used it along with the Vis pistol and the Szabla wz.34. The first series was ordered in March 1939 and additional purchases were planned. However, until September 1939 the Fabryka Karabinów in Warsaw produced only 39, 3 of these being the prototypes. After the start of hostilities, all were issued to one infantry battalion and were used with success during the battle for Warsaw.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9107504;New Heavy Machine Gun Design: The Schwarzlose HMG;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9107504;The Schwarzlose M. 7 was a water-cooled, belt-fed weapon designed by a German named Andreas Wilhelm Schwarzlose. It was usually mounted on a tripod and looked broadly similar to the family of Maxim-derived machine-guns such as the British Vickers and the German Maschinengewehr 08. The Schwarzlose, however, was of simpler design and featured an unusual, delayed blowback mechanism which contained only a single spring. The initial variants of the M.07/12 had a cyclic rate of about 400 rounds/minute, but this was later increased to 580 rounds/minute during World War I by fitting the mechanism with a stronger spring. The Schwarzlose was a robust and reliable weapon in its intended role as an infantry weapon, but unlike the highly adaptable Maxim-derived machine guns, met with less success when it was used in roles it had not been designed for. The simplicity of its design however, made the weapon very inexpensive to manufacture.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9107505;New Heavy Machine Gun Design: The Ckm wz. 30 HMG;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9107505;Ckm wz. 30 is a Polish-made clone of the American Browning M1917 heavy machine gun. Produced with various modifications such as greater caliber, longer barrel and adjustable sighting device, it was an improved although unlicensed copy of its predecessor, and was the standard machine gun of the Polish Army since 1931.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9107506;New Mortar Design: The Granatnik wz. 36;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9107506;The Granatnik wz.36 was a Polish grenade launcher designed in originally in 1927 as "wz. 30" and later modified in 1936. It entered service in 1936 becoming the standard grenade launcher of the Polish Army. It was still in use during the German Invasion of Poland in 1939.  The wz.30 had a maximum range of 700 meters; this was increased to 800 meters in the wz.36. They both fired the same 46 mm shell, weighting 0.76 kg. About 3,850 of these 46 mm mortars were produced by 1939. Typically 81 such mortars were distributed to each Polish infantry division—three per company.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9107507;New Anti-Tank Rifle Design: The Wz. 35;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9107507;Karabin przeciwpancerny wzor 35, also UR, was a Polish 7.9 mm anti-tank rifle used by the Polish Army during the Invasion of Poland of 1939.  The weapon was initially a top secret of the Polish Army, and was also known by various codenames. Until mobilization in 1939, the combat-ready rifles were held in closed crates enigmatically marked: "Do not open! Surveillance equipment!".;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9107508;New Light Tank Design: The 7TP;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9107508;The 7TP was a Polish light tank of the Second World War. A development of the British Vickers 6-ton, it was significantly better armed than its most common opponents, the German Panzer I and Panzer II. A standard tank of the Polish Army during the 1939 Invasion of Poland, its production never exceeded 150 vehicles. Its chassis was used as the base for C7P artillery tractor.;;;;;;;;;;x
