EVTNAME9105300;New Rifle Design: The Springfield 1903 Bolt Action Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105300;The M1903 Springfield, formally the United States Rifle, Caliber .30-06, Model 1903, is an American clip-loaded, 5-round magazine fed, bolt-action service rifle used primarily during the first half of the 20th century. It was officially adopted as a United States military bolt-action rifle on June 19, 1903, and saw service in World War I. It was officially replaced as the standard infantry rifle by the faster-firing semi-automatic 8-round M1 Garand starting in 1937. However, the M1903 Springfield remained in service as a standard issue infantry rifle during World War II, since the U.S. entered the war without sufficient M1 rifles to arm all troops. It also remained in service as a sniper rifle during World War II, the Korean War, and even in the early stages of the Vietnam War. It remains popular as a civilian firearm, historical collector's piece, and as a military drill rifle.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105301;New Semi-Automatic Rifle Design: The M1 Garand Semi-Automatic Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105301;The M1 Garand is a semi-automatic rifle chambered for the .30-06 Springfield rifle cartridge. It was the first standard-issue semi-automatic rifle. Called "the greatest battle implement ever devised" by General George S. Patton, the Garand officially replaced the bolt-action M1903 Springfield as the standard service rifle of the United States Armed Forces in 1936 (although the switch was not instantaneous) and was subsequently replaced by the selective-fire M14, starting in 1957. During World War II, the M1 gave U.S. forces a distinct advantage in firefights against their Axis enemies, as their standard-issue rifles were more effective than the Axis' slower-firing bolt-action rifles. The M1 continued to be used in large numbers until 1963 and to a lesser degree until 1976. Like its predecessor, the M1 originated from the Springfield Armory. Today, the M1 remains in use for drill purposes. The M1 is an air-cooled, gas-operated, clip-fed, semi-automatic, shoulder-fired weapon. This means that the air cools the barrel, that the power to cock the rifle and chamber the succeeding round comes from the expanding gas of the round fired previously, that it is loaded by inserting an en-bloc metal clip (containing eight rounds) into the receiver, and that the rifle fires one round each time the trigger is pulled. After the eight rounds have been shot, the empty clip automatically ejects with an audible "ping" noise. The M1 was the standard-issue service rifle of the U.S. forces in World War II and the Korean War, and also saw service to a limited extent in the Vietnam War. Most M1 rifles were issued to U.S. forces, though many thousands were also lent or provided as foreign aid to America's allies.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105302;New Semi-Automatic Rifle Design: The Johnson 1941 Semi-Automatic Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105302;This system had some advantages over the M1 Rifle, including less perceived recoil and greater magazine capacity. Unfortunately, the Johnson's recoiling barrel mechanism resulted in excessive vertical shot dispersion that was never fully cured during its production life, and was prone to malfunction when a bayonet was attached to the reciprocating barrel. The Johnson also employed a number of small parts that were easily lost during field stripping. Partially because of lack of development, the M1941 was less rugged and reliable than the M1, though this was a matter of degree and was not universally opined amongst those that had used both weapons in combat.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105303;New Submachinegun Design: The M1 Thompson Submachinegun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105303;In 1938, the Thompson submachine gun was adopted by the U.S. military, serving during World War II and beyond. There were two military types of Thompson SMG. The M1928A1 had provisions for box and drum magazines. It had a Cutts compensator, cooling fins on the barrel, employed a delayed blowback action and its charging handle was on the top of the receiver. The M1 and M1A1 had a barrel without cooling fins, a simplified rear sight, provisions only for box magazines, employed a straight blowback action and the charging handle was on the side of the receiver. Over 1.5 million military Thompson submachine guns were produced during World War II.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105304;New Light Machine Gun Rifle Design: The Browning M1918 BAR;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105304;The BAR was designed to be carried by advancing infantrymen, slung over the shoulder or fired from the hip, a concept called "walking fire"—thought to be necessary for the individual soldier during trench warfare. However, in practice, it was most often used as a light machine gun and fired from a bipod (introduced in later models). A variant of the original M1918 BAR, the Colt Monitor Machine Rifle, remains the lightest production automatic gun to fire the .30-06 Springfield cartridge, though the limited capacity of its standard 20-round magazine tended to hamper its utility in that role.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105305;New Heavy Machine Gun Design: The Browning M1917 HMG;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105305;The M1917 Browning machine gun is a heavy machine gun used by the United States armed forces in World War I, World War II, Korea, and to a limited extent in Vietnam, it has also been used by other nations. It was a crew served, belt-fed, water-cooled machine gun that served alongside the much lighter air-cooled Browning M1919. It was used at the battalion level, and often mounted on vehicles (such as a jeep). There were two main iterations of it: the M1917, which was used in World War I; and the M1917A1; which was used thereafter. The M1917, which was used on some aircraft as well as in a ground role, had a firing rate of 450 rounds per minute, the M1917A1 had a firing rate of 450 to 600 rounds per minute.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105306;New Heavy Machine Gun Design: The Browning M1919 HMG;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105306;The M1919 Browning is a .30 caliber medium machine gun widely used during the 20th century, especially during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. An air-cooled development of the standard US machine gun of World War I, the John M. Browning-designed M1917, the M1919 saw service as a light infantry, coaxial, mounted, aircraft, and anti-aircraft machine gun by the U.S. and many other countries. Although it began to be superseded by newer designs, such as the M60, in the later half of the century, it remained in use in many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries and elsewhere for much longer.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105307;New Submachinegun Design: The M3 Greasegun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105307;The M3 was an American .45-caliber submachine gun adopted for U.S. Army service on 12 December 1942, as the United States Submachine Gun, Cal. .45, M3. The M3 was chambered for the same .45 round fired by the Thompson submachine gun, but was cheaper to produce, lighter, and more accurate. The M3 was commonly referred to as the "Grease Gun" or simply "the Greaser," owing to its visual similarity to a mechanic's grease gun. Intended as a replacement for the .45-caliber Thompson series of submachine guns, the M3 and its improved successor, the M3A1 began to replace the Thompson in first-line service in late 1944 and early 1945. Due to delays caused by production issues and approved specification changes, the M3/M3A1 saw relatively little combat use in World War II.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105308;New Carbine Design: The M1 Paratrooper Carbine;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105308;The M1 carbine (formally the United States Carbine, Caliber .30, M1) is a lightweight .30 caliber semi-automatic carbine that became a standard firearm for the U.S. military during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and was produced in several variants. Easy-to-use, it was widely used by U.S. and foreign military, paramilitary and police forces, and has also been a popular civilian firearm. In selective-fire versions capable of fully automatic firing, the carbine is designated the M2 carbine. The M3 carbine was an M2 with an active infrared scope system. Unlike conventional carbines, which are generally shorter-barreled versions of a longer parent rifle (like the earlier .30-40 U.S. Krag rifle and carbine and the later M16 rifle and M4 carbine), the M1 carbine has only one minor part in common with the unrelated larger M1 Garand, a short buttplate screw, and fires a different cartridge.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105309;New Mortar Design: The M1 81mm Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105309;The M1 mortar is an American 81 millimeter caliber mortar. It was based on the French Brandt mortar. The M1 mortar was used from World War II until the 1950s when it was replaced by the lighter and longer ranged M29 mortar.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105310;New Mortar Design: The M2 60mm Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105310;The U.S. M2 60 mm mortar was developed from the heavier 81 mm M1 Mortar to provide a lighter-weight alternative to company-level fire support. The M2 attempted to bridge the gap between the 81 mm mortar and the hand grenade. Normally employed by the weapons platoon of a U.S. infantry company, the M2 is of the usual mortar pattern of the day. It consists of a smoothbore metal tube on a rectangular baseplate, supported by a simple bipod with the elevation and traverse mechanisms. The firing pin was fixed in the base cap of the tube, and the bomb was fired automatically when it dropped down the barrel. Though classed as a light mortar, the M2 had considerable range compared to the 50 mm and 60 mm mortars of most other nations, and its fixed-firing pin design allowed a high rate of fire by trained crews.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105311;New Mortar Design: The M19 60mm Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105311;The original M19 just had a simple spade-like M1 baseplate, leaving the elevation and traverse free for the firer. This of course was found to be too inaccurate, and the infantry initially refused the M19. A new mount, the M5, was developed, which used a conventional baseplate and bipod with elevation and traverse adjustment. This gave the M19 better accuracy, but made it heavier than the M2 Mortar with less range. The M19 fired the same ammunition used in the M2 mortar, which it would replace. The 60 mm mortar is used by the infantry to lob high-explosive and white phosphorus smoke shells at well-protected hostile locations. The weapon can also fire illumination rounds to light up the battlefield at night. The primary difference between the M2 and M19 was that the M2 was drop-fire only while the M19 could be drop-fired or a round loaded and then fired by a lever-like trigger at the base of the tube.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105312;New Infantry Anti-Tank Rocket Design: The M1 Bazooka Rocket Launcher;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105312;Bazooka is the common name for a man-portable recoilless antitank rocket launcher weapon, widely fielded by the United States Army. Also referred to as the "Stovepipe", the innovative bazooka was among the first generation of rocket-propelled anti-tank weapons used in infantry combat. Featuring a solid rocket motor for propulsion, it allowed for high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles, machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine. The bazooka also fired a HESH round, effective against buildings and tank armor. The universally applied nickname arose from the M1 variant's vague resemblance to the musical instrument called a "bazooka" invented and popularized by 1930s U.S. comedian Bob Burns. During World War II, German armed forces captured several bazookas in early North African and Eastern Front encounters and soon reverse engineered their own version, increasing the warhead diameter to 8.8 cm (among other minor changes) and widely issuing it as the Raketenpanzerbüchse "Panzerschreck" ("Tank terror").;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105313;New Infantry Recoilless Rifle Design: The M20 75mm Recoilless Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105313;The M20 recoilless rifle was a U.S. 75 mm caliber recoilless rifle used during the last months of the Second World War and extensively during the Korean War. It could be fired from an M1917A1 .30 caliber machine gun tripod, or from a vehicle mount, typically a Jeep. Its shaped charge warhead, also known as HEAT, was capable of penetrating 100 mm of armor. Although the weapon proved ineffective against the T-34 tank during the Korean War, it was used primarily as a close infantry support weapon to engage all types of targets including infantry and lightly armored vehicles. The M20 proved useful against pillboxes and other types of field fortifications.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105314;New Infantry Howitzer Design: The M101 105mm Medium Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105314;The 105 mm M2A1 (M101A1) howitzer was a howitzer developed and used by the United States. It was the standard U.S. light field howitzer in World War II and saw action in both the European and Pacific theaters. Entering production in 1941, it quickly gained a reputation for accuracy and a powerful punch. The M101A1 fired 105 mm high explosive (HE) semi-fixed ammunition and had a range of 11,270 meters, or 12,325 yards, making it suitable for supporting infantry. All of these qualities of the weapon, along with its widespread production, led to its adoption by many countries after the war. Its ammunition type also became the standard for many foreign countries' later models.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105315;New Medium Field Gun Design: The M1918 155 GPF 155mm Medium Field Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105315;The American M1918 155mm GPF was a copy of the French mle. 1917 field gun and utilized by the US Army and US Marines up to 1945.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105316;New Medium Field Gun Design: The M59 (M2 Long Tom) 155mm Medium Field Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105316;The 155mm Long Tom was a 155mm caliber field gun developed and used by the United States military. It was produced in M1 and M2 variants (later known as the M59). Developed to replace the Canon de 155mm GPF, the gun was deployed as a heavy field weapon during World War II and the Korean War, and also classed as secondary armament for seacoast defense. The gun could fire a 45.36 kg (100 lb) shell to a maximum range of 22 km (13.7 mi), with an estimated accuracy life of 1,500 rounds.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105317;New Medium Howitzer Design: The M114 155mm Medium Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105317;The M114 155 mm howitzer was a towed howitzer developed and used by the United States Army. It was first produced in 1942 as a medium artillery piece under the designation of 155 mm Howitzer M1. It saw service with the US Army during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, before being replaced by the M198 howitzer.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105318;New Pack Howitzer Design: The M1 75mm Pack Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105318;The 75mm Pack Howitzer M1 (also known by its post-war designation M116) was designed in the United States in the 1920s to meet a need for an artillery piece that could be moved across difficult terrain. The gun and carriage was designed so that it could be broken down into several pieces to be carried by pack animals. The gun saw combat in the Second World War with the United States Army (primarily used by airborne units), with US Marine Corps, and was also supplied to foreign forces.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105319;New Airborne Howitzer Design: The M3 105mm Light Airborne Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105319;The M3 started its life as a shortened version of the M2105mm field howitzer. It was intended from the start to be used for airborne and jungle operations, so was required to be reasonably light, compact, and easily transportable.  Due to its weight it was light enough to be paradropped.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105320;New Heavy Howitzer Design: The M115 203mm Heavy Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105320;The M115 203 mm howitzer, also known as the M115 8 inch howitzer, was a towed howitzer developed and used by the United States Army. Until the 1950s it was designated the 8 inch Howitzer M1. The original design started in 1919 but lapsed until resurrected in 1927 as a partner-piece for a new 155 mm gun. It was standardised as 8 inch Howitzer M1 in 1940. The M115/M1 was towed by the M35 Prime Mover gun tractor or a Mack 7 1⁄3 ton 6x6 truck.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105321;New Heavy Howitzer Design: The Little David Siege Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105321;Little David was the nickname of an American 36-inch (910 mm) caliber mortar used for test firing aerial bombs during World War II, that is one of the largest calibre guns ever built, having a larger calibre than both of Germany's Dora and Gustav which were 31.5-inch (800 mm) railway guns. Great Britain's Mallet's Mortar had an identical calibre.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105322;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The M3 37mm Anti-Tank Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105322;The 37 mm Gun M3 was the first dedicated anti-tank gun fielded by United States forces in numbers. Introduced in 1940, it became the standard anti-tank gun of the U.S. infantry with its size enabling it to be pulled by a jeep. However, the continuing improvement of German tanks quickly rendered the 37 mm ineffective, and by 1943 it was being gradually replaced in the European and Mediterranean theaters by the more powerful British-developed 57 mm Gun M1. In the Pacific, where the Japanese tank threat was less significant, the M3 remained in service until the end of the war. Like many other light anti-tank guns, the M3 was widely used in the infantry support role and as an anti-personnel weapon, firing high-explosive and canister rounds.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105323;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The M1 57mm Anti-Tank Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105323;The American M1 57mm Anti-Tank Gun was nothing more than a redesignation of the British 6 Pounder Anti-Tank Gun.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105324;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The T8 90mm Anti-Tank Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105324;The 90 mm Gun M1/M2/M3 served as a primary heavy American anti-aircraft and anti-tank gun, playing a role similar to the renowned German 88 mm gun. It was 90 mm (3.5 in) in caliber, and had a 4.60 m (15 ft) barrel, 53 calibers in length. It was capable of firing a 90×600 mm R shell 17,823 m (58,474 ft) horizontally, or a maximum altitude of 10,380 m (34,060 ft). The 90 mm Gun was the US's primary anti-aircraft gun from just prior to the opening of World War II into the 1950s, when most anti-aircraft artillery was replaced by guided missile systems. As a tank gun, it was the main weapon of the M36 tank destroyer and M26 Pershing tank, as well as a number of post-war tanks. It was briefly deployed 1943-46 as a coast defense weapon with the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105325;New Anti-Aircraft Gun Design: The M1918 76.2mm Anti-Aircraft Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105325;The 3-inch M1918 gun was a United States 3-inch anti-aircraft gun that entered service in 1918 and served until it was finally superseded by the 3" M3 gun in 1930. The M3 was subsequently replaced by the M1 90mm AA gun just prior to the opening of World War II. The M3 3" gun was later adapted for the anti-tank role, serving as the main armament of the M10 tank destroyer during World War II.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105326;New Anti-Aircraft Gun Design: The M1 90mm Anti-Aircraft Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105326;The 90 mm Gun M1/M2/M3 served as a primary heavy American anti-aircraft and anti-tank gun, playing a role similar to the renowned German 88 mm gun. It was 90 mm (3.5 in) in caliber, and had a 4.60 m (15 ft) barrel, 53 calibers in length. It was capable of firing a 90×600 mm R shell 17,823 m (58,474 ft) horizontally, or a maximum altitude of 10,380 m (34,060 ft). The 90 mm Gun was the US's primary anti-aircraft gun from just prior to the opening of World War II into the 1950s, when most anti-aircraft artillery was replaced by guided missile systems. As a tank gun, it was the main weapon of the M36 tank destroyer and M26 Pershing tank, as well as a number of post-war tanks. It was briefly deployed 1943-46 as a coast defense weapon with the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105327;New Anti-Aircraft Gun Design: The M1 120mm Anti-Aircraft Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105327;The 120 mm Gun M1 was the United States Army's standard super-heavy anti-aircraft gun, complementing the smaller and more mobile M2 90 mm gun in service. Its maximum altitude was about 60,000 ft (18,000 m), and was nicknamed the stratosphere gun. The 120 served primarily in static defensive roles, although it had been designed to be mobile.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105328;New Anti-Aircraft Gun Design: The M45 Quadmount 50.Cal(Maxson) Anti-Aircraft Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105328;The M45 Quadmount (nicknamed the "meat chopper" and "Krautmower" for its high rate of fire) was a weapon mounting consisting of four of the "HB", or "heavy barrel" .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns (of the M2 Turret Type (TT) variant) mounted in pairs on each side of an open, electrically powered turret. It was developed by the W. L. Maxson Corporation to replace the earlier M33 twin mount (also from Maxson). Although designed as an anti-aircraft weapon, it was also used against ground targets. Introduced in 1943 during World War II, it remained in US service as late as the Vietnam War.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105329;New Rocket Artillery Gun Design: The M21 114mm Rocket Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105329;The M21 Rocket Launcher was an attempt by the American Army to copy the German Wehrmacht Nebelwerfer.  Historically, it never was used in World War II, but it was shipped off to Korea.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105330;New Rocket Artillery Gun Design: The Rocket Launcher T34 (Calliope);;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105330;The Rocket Launcher T34 (Calliope) was a tank-mounted multiple rocket launcher used by the United States Army during World War II. The launcher was placed atop the Medium Tank M4, and fired a barrage of 4.5 in (114 mm) M8 rockets from 60 launch tubes. It was developed in 1943; small numbers were produced and were used by various US armor units in 1944-45. It adopts its name from the musical instrument "Calliope", also known as the steam organ, which had similarly lined pipes.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105331;New Mobile Mortar Artillery Design: The T19/M21 81mm MMC SP Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105331;The M21 Mortar Motor Carriage (MMC) was a self-propelled artillery mount on a half-track chassis used by the United States Army during World War II. It was equipped with one 81 mm M1 mortar and an air-cooled M2 Browning machine gun. It was produced by the White Motor Company in 1944. Only 110 examples were produced. It mainly served on the Western Front in Normandy, and Southern France, and then later in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge. It was deemed to have been outclassed in 1945 when the 81 mm M1 mortar was found to have insufficient power to provide effective artillery support.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105332;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The M3 Gun Motor Carriage 75mm SP Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105332;The 75mm Gun Motor Carriage M3 was a United States tank destroyer and self-propelled artillery piece of World War II. It was the most numerous tank destroyer in United States Army service during the critical battles in North Africa and the Philippines, and continued to be used in more limited numbers in Sicily, before being declared obsolete in early 1944. The GMC M3 was then used by the regimental weapons companies of Marine regiments in 1944–1945 at Saipan, Peleliu and Okinawa.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105333;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The M8 Scott 75mm SP Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105333;The first design for a close support howitzer on an M5 tank chassis was the T41, which had the howitzer in the hull front. This did not progress past the mock-up stage as the crew would not have been sufficiently protected and design work started on the T47. It was developed on the chassis of the then-new Light Tank M5 (Stuart VI). The prototype was designated the T17E1 HMC. It had the standard M5 turret removed and replaced with a larger open-topped turret, as a result, the drivers' hatches had to be moved from the hull roof to the glacis plate. After a mock-up had been produced, it was ordered into production.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105334;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The M7 Priest 105mm SP Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105334;The 105 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M7 was an American self-propelled artillery vehicle produced during World War II. It was given the official service name 105 mm Self Propelled Gun, Priest by the British Army, due to the pulpit-like machine gun ring, and following on from the Bishop and the contemporary Deacon self-propelled guns.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105335;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The M12 155mm SP Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105335;The M12 was built on the chassis of the M3 Lee tank. It had an armored driver's compartment shared with the commander, but the gun crew were located in an open topped area at the back of the vehicle. The engine was moved forward to the center of the vehicle and most vehicles used M4 bogies with trailing return rollers. It mounted a 155 mm gun M1917, M1917A1 or M1918 M1, depending upon availability, a weapon derived from the nearly identical French 155 mm GPF gun of World War I vintage. Limited storage space meant that only 10 projectiles and propellant charges could be carried on the vehicle. An earth spade (similar to a bulldozer blade) at the rear was employed to absorb recoil. This layout—large gun mounted in an open mount at the rear, with a spade—was the pattern adopted for many years by other heavy self-propelled artillery.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105336;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The M37 105mm Howitzer SP Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105336;The M37 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage was developed to provide a lighter, more mobile replacement for the M7 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage. It appeared too late to see service in the Second World War but was used in combat during the Korean War.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105337;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The M41 Gorilla 155mm Howitzer SP Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105337;The M41 155mm Howitzer Motor Carriage was based on the M24 Chaffee light tank. It entered service too late to see combat in the Second World War, but was used in the Korean War.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105338;New Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Design: The M15 Halftrack 37mm SP Anti-Aircraft Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105338;The M15 was based on the M3 Halftrack chassis, adding a coaxially mounted armament of a fully automatic M1 37 mm (1.5 in) gun and two superior placed .50 cal (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns. Manned by a crew of seven, it was 20 ft 3 in (6.17 m) long, 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) wide, 7 ft 10 in (2.39 m) high, and had a wheelbase of 135.5 in (3.44 m). The vehicle's armor was up to 12 mm thick and it weighed 9.45 t (20,800 lb). The suspension was leaf spring on the front axle and vertical volute spring for the tracks. A 386 in3 White 160AX, 128 hp 6-cylinder gasoline engine gave the M15 a power-to-weight ratio of 15.8 hp per ton and a maximum road speed of 41.9 mph (67.4 km/h).

EVTNAME9105339;New Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Design: The M19 40mm SP Anti-Aircraft Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105339;The M19 Twin 40mm was ready for action by April of 1945 but the end of the war limited its reach and production to just 300 systems. It was basically two 40mm cannons mounted on the chassis of the M24 Chaffee.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105340;New Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Design: The T77 x6 50. Cal Turret SP Anti-Aircraft Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105340;In July 1943, the Committee of the U.S. military weapons technology recommends the development of a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, which is based on light tank M24, equipped with heavy 12.7 mm M2HB machine guns. The T77. Request for four machineguns, they designed for six machineguns! In April 1944, two prototypes were presented and went in test in October. The year after, it went to Aberdeen Proving Ground for various tests. It was the M24 chassis equip with a new designed turret. A very strange conspicuous part are the two glass domes on the turret and are made for a bether vieuw on the battlefield and in the sky without danger the enemy throw grenades in the compartment. Historically, it went never in production.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105341;New Tankette Design: The M1 Tankette;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105341;The M1 Combat Car was a light tank used by the U.S. Cavalry in the late 1930s. Developed at the same time as the infantry's very similar M2 Light tank. After the Spanish Civil War, most armies, including the U.S. Army, realized that they needed tanks armed with cannons, not merely vehicles armed with machine guns, and so the M1 became obsolete.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105342;New Light Tank Design: The M2 Light Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105342;The Light Tank M2 was an American pre-World War II light tank which saw limited use during World War II. The most common model, the M2A4, was equipped with one 37 mm (1.5 in) M5 gun, one .50 M2 Browning machine gun, and five .30 cal M1919 Browning machine guns.  It was originally developed from the prototype T2 tank built by Rock Island Arsenal, which had a Vickers-type leaf spring suspension. The suspension was replaced by the superior vertical volute system in the T2E1 series of 1935. This was put into production with minor modifications as the M2A1 in 1936, with ten produced. The main pre-war version was the M2A2, with 239 produced, becoming the main tank in the US Army infantry units in the pre-war period. The Spanish Civil War showed that tanks armed only with machine guns were ineffective. This led to the M2A4 with a 37 mm gun as the main armament. 375 were delivered, the last ten as late as April 1942.  Its only combat use in American units was with the US Marine Corps 1st Tank Battalion during the Pacific War in 1942. However, it is believed that M2A4s served in Burma and India with the British 7th Hussars and 2nd Royal Tank Regiment during their engagements with the Imperial Japanese Army's 14th Tank Regiment. The M2A4 light tank led to the M3 Stuart light tank, the M2 Medium Tank and M4 Tractor artillery tower. The M3 Stuart saw widespread use throughout the war, the M2 Medium Tank, though another unsuccessful design led to the M3 Lee and thence the M4 Sherman medium tanks.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105343;New Light Tank Design: The M3 Stuart Light Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105343;The M3 Stuart, formally Light Tank M3, is an American light tank of World War II. It was supplied to British and Commonwealth forces under lend-lease prior to the entry of the U.S. into the war. Thereafter, it was used by U.S. and Allied forces until the end of the war.  The name General Stuart or Stuart given by the British comes from the American Civil War Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart and was used for both the M3 and the derivative M5 Light Tank. In British service, it also had the unofficial nickname of Honey after a tank driver remarked "She's a honey". To the United States Army, the tanks were officially known only as "Light Tank M3" and "Light Tank M5". The M3 Stuarts were the first American-crewed tanks in World War II to engage the enemy in tank versus tank combat.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105344;New Light Tank Design: The M5 Stuart Light Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105344;The light tank M5 was a modified light tank M3 with a new power train and an improved armor layout. A radial engine shortage was expected in 1941, and it was decided to find alternative engines to power tanks. The engines in the M5 were Cadillac automobile engines, each with its own transmission. The hull was all-welded, and the glacis was sloped and moved out to make more room for the drivers. The drivers had their own hatches which were equipped with periscopes. Direct vision for the drivers was through two peepholes which were closed with steel plugs attached with chains. The M5's turret was the same as that on the light tank M3A1, but the lower height presented by the new transmissions and driveshafts allowed the turret traverse mechanism to be attached to the underside of the turret basket, giving the turret crew more room. The M5 was originally known as light tank M4, but was redesignated to M5 to avoid confusion with the medium tank M4. The British called the M5 Stuart VI.  The major distinguishing features between the light tanks M5 and M3A3 are the hull sides and rear deck. The M5 had a raised rear deck to accomodate the twin Cadillac engines and vertical hull sides, while the M3A3 had sloping upper hull sides and a flat engine deck.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105345;New Light Tank Design: The M22 Locust Light Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105345;The Light Tank (Airborne) M22 or Locust was an American-designed airmobile light tank which was produced during World War II. The Locust began development in 1941 after the British War Office requested that the American government design a purpose-built airborne light tank which could be transported by glider into battle to support British airborne forces. The War Office had originally selected the Light Tank Mark VII Tetrarch light tank for use by the airborne forces, but it had not been designed with that exact purpose in mind so the War Office believed that a purpose-built tank would be required to replace it. The United States Ordnance Department was asked to produce this replacement, which in turn selected Marmon-Herrington to design and build a prototype airborne tank in May 1941. The prototype was designated the Light Tank T9 (Airborne), and was designed so that it could be transported underneath a Douglas C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft, although its dimensions also allowed it to fit inside a General Aircraft Hamilcar glider.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105346;New Light Tank Design: The M24 Chaffee Light Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105346;The M24 Chaffee was intended to replace the aging and obsolete Light Tank M5 (Stuart), which was used in supplementary roles. The first thirty-four M24s reached Europe in November 1944 and were issued to the U.S. 2nd Cavalry Group (Mechanized) in France. These were then issued to Troop F, 2nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron and Troop F, 42nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, which each received seventeen M24s. During the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, these units and their new tanks were rushed to the southern sector, two of the M24s were detached to serve with the 740th Tank Battalion of the U.S. First Army.  The M24 started to enter widespread issue in December 1944, but they were slow in reaching the front-line combat units. By the end of the war, many armored divisions were still mainly equipped with the M3/M5 Stuart. Some armored divisions did not receive their first M24s until the war was over.  Reports from the armored divisions that received them prior to the end of hostilities were generally positive. Crews liked the improved off-road performance and reliability, but were most appreciative of the 75 mm main gun, which was a vast improvement over the 37 mm. The M24 was not up to the challenge of fighting German tanks, but the bigger gun at least gave its crews a much better chance to fight back when it was required. The M24's light armor made it vulnerable to virtually all German tanks, anti-tank guns, and hand-held anti-tank weapons. The contribution of the M24 to winning the war in Europe was insignificant, as too few arrived too late to replace the worn-out M5s of the armored divisions.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105347;New Medium Tank Design: The M3 Lee/M3 Grant Medium Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105347;The Medium Tank M3 was an American tank used during World War II. In Britain the tank was called by two names based on the turret configuration. Tanks employing US pattern turrets were called the "Lee", named after Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Variants using British pattern turrets were known as "Grant", named after U.S. General Ulysses S. Grant.  Design commenced in July 1940 and the first M3s were operational in late 1941. The U.S. Army needed a good tank and coupled with the United Kingdom's demand for 3,650 medium tanks immediately, the Lee began production by late 1940. The design was a compromise meant to produce a tank as soon as possible. The M3 had considerable firepower as it was well armed and provided good protection, but had certain serious drawbacks in its general design and shape, such as: a high silhouette, an archaic sponson mounting of the main gun, riveted construction, and poor off-road performance. Its overall performance was not satisfactory and the tank was withdrawn from front line duty — except in the remote areas of the Asian Theater by British forces as late as mid-1944 or later — as soon as the M4 Sherman became available in large numbers.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105348;New Medium Tank Design: The M4 Sherman Medium Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105348;The M4 Sherman, officially Medium Tank, M4, was the most numerous battle tank used by the United States and some other Western Allies in World War II. It proved to be reliable and mobile. In spite of being outclassed by German medium and heavy tanks late in the war, the M4 Sherman was cheaper to produce and available in greater numbers. Thousands were distributed through the Lend-Lease program to the British Commonwealth and Soviet Union. The tank was named after the American Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman by the British.  The M4 Sherman evolved from the interim M3 Medium Tank, which had its main armament in a side sponson mount. The M4 retained much of the previous mechanical design but put the main 75 mm gun in a fully traversing turret. One controversial feature, a one-axis gyrostabilizer was not precise enough to allow firing when moving but did help keep the reticle on-target, so that when the tank did stop to fire, the gun would be aimed in roughly the right direction. The designers stressed mechanical reliability, ease of production and maintenance, durability, standardization of parts and ammunition in a limited number of variants, and moderate size and weight. These factors combined with M4 Sherman's then-superior armor and armament outclassed German light and medium tanks of 1939–41. The M4 went on to be produced in large numbers. It spearheaded many offensives by the Western Allies after 1942. A similar vehicle was developed at the same time in Canada, the Ram tank, however greater Sherman production and availability meant that the Ram was never used in action as a tank (many were converted to self-propelled guns and Kangaroo armoured personnel carriers).  When the M4 tank arrived in North Africa in 1942, it was superior to the lighter German long-barrel 50 mm-gunned Panzer III and short-barrel 75 mm-gunned Panzer IV. For this reason, the US Army believed the M4 would be adequate to win the war, and no pressure was exerted for further tank development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105349;New Medium Tank Design: The M26 Pershing Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105349;The Pershing was a heavy tank of the United States Army. It was designated a heavy tank when it was first designed in World War II due to its 90mm gun, and its armor. The tank is named after General of the Armies John J. Pershing, who led the American Expeditionary Force in Europe in World War I. It was briefly used both in World War II and the Korean War.  Intended as an improvement of the M4 Sherman, the prolonged time of development meant that only a small number saw combat in the European theater, most notably in the 9th Armored Division's dramatic dash to take the Ludendorff Bridge during the Battle of Remagen. Based on the criteria of firepower, mobility, and protection, R. P. Hunnicutt ranked the Pershing second, behind the German Panther medium tank, but ahead of the Tiger I heavy tank. In service during the Korean War, the M26 overmatched the T-34-85 in terms of firepower and protection, but was challenged by the hilly and muddy terrain, and as a result was withdrawn in 1951 in favor of its improved derivative, the M46 Patton, which had a considerably more powerful and reliable engine as well as an advanced and improved suspension to better meet the demands of the specific terrain it operated in. The lineage of the M26 continued with the M47 Patton, and was reflected in the new designs of the later M48 Patton and M60 Patton.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105350;New Medium Tank Design: The T30 Super Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105350;The Heavy Tank T30 was a World War II American tank project developed to counter new German tanks, such as Tiger I, Tiger II, and the Jagdtiger or Soviet heavy tanks, such as IS-1 or IS-2.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105351;New Amphibious Tank Design: The M4 Sherman DD Amphibious Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105351;DD or Duplex Drive tanks, nicknamed "Donald Duck tanks", were a type of amphibious swimming tank developed by the British during the Second World War. The phrase is mostly used for the Duplex Drive variant of the M4 Sherman medium tank, that was used by the Western Allies during and after the Normandy Landings in June 1944.  DD tanks worked by erecting a 'flotation screen' around the tank, which enabled it to float, and had a propeller powered by the tank's engine to drive them in the water.  The DD tanks were one of the many specialized assault vehicles, collectively known as Hobart's Funnies, devised to support the planned invasion of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105352;New Light Tank Destroyer Design: The T48 57mm GMC Light Tank Destroyer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105352;The T48 57mm Gun Motor Carriage was a self-propelled anti-tank gun produced by the Diamond T company in 1943 for the United States. The design incorporated a 57 mm gun M1, a US production of the British Ordnance QF 6 pounder, mounted on an M3 Half-track.  A total of 962 vehicles were produced from 1942 to 1943. It had originally been planned that Britain would receive all of the examples produced through Lend-Lease, intending to use them in the Western Desert, but by the time they arrived the campaign was over. Additionally, the purpose-built M10 tank destroyer, armed with a 75 mm gun (and later a 17-pounder gun in British service) had begun to enter production. As a result, the British transferred 650 half-tracks to the Soviet Union under the Soviet Aid Program. Britain retained 30 and the remainder were taken by the US, these British and American vehicles were converted back to standard M3 Half-tracks, except for one kept by the U.S. Army.  The Soviets called it the SU-57, and under this designation it served in Operation Bagration and other fighting on the Eastern Front during World War II.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105353;New Medium Tank Destroyer Design: The M10 Wolverine 76.2mm GMC Medium Tank Destroyer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105353;The M10 tank destroyer was a United States tank destroyer of World War II based on the chassis of the M4 Sherman tank fitted with the 3-inch (76.2 mm) Gun M7. Formally 3-inch Gun Motor Carriage, M10, it was numerically the most important U.S. tank destroyer of World War II and combined a reasonably potent anti-tank weapon with a turreted platform (unlike the previous M3 GMC, whose gun was capable of only limited traverse). Despite the introduction of more-powerful types as replacements, it remained in service until the end of the war, and its chassis was later reused with a new turret to create the M36 Jackson, which used a 90mm gun instead of the 76.2mm gun.  It was christened the Wolverine by the British, although unlike other vehicle names such as the M4 Sherman, the name was not adopted by American soldiers, who called it TD (a nickname for any tank destroyer in general) beyond its formal designation.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105354;New Medium Tank Destroyer Design: The M18 Hellcat 76.2mm GMC Medium Tank Destroyer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105354;The M18 had a gasoline powered, 400 hp, Continental R-975 engine and it was capable of speeds of up to 88.5 km/h. It also had a crew of five men and it had a 3 speed forward, 1 speed reverse transmission. The M18 had torsion bar suspension system with five wheels on each side of the tank destroyer. The armament consisted of an M1A1 76.2 mm main gun and a 12.7 mm Browning M2HB on top of the turret. The M18 also had a weight of 18,143.6 kg and a length of 6.35 meters. It could carry 624.5 liters, 45 rounds for the main gun, 800 rounds for the 12.7 mm machine gun, and it had a maximum range of 168.9 km. The armor was 12.7 mm in most areas of the tank including the sides and the frontal armor plate. It was a 6 mm thick in the underside of the vehicle and it was 7.9 mm at the top. Overall, the armor was hardly enough to deflect most enemy tank shells, meaning that speed was the Hellcat's largest advantage.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105355;New Medium Tank Destroyer Design: The M36 Jackson/Slugger 90mm GMC Medium Tank Destroyer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105355;The M36 tank destroyer, formally 90 mm Gun Motor Carriage, M36, was an American tank destroyer used during World War II. The M36 was essentially an up-gunned M10 tank destroyer, replacing the former's 3 inch (76.2mm) M7 gun with a powerful 90 mm gun.  The M36 first served in combat in Europe in September 1944, where it proved to be a match for any of the tanks being fielded by the Germans. It also saw use in the Korean War, able to defeat any of the Soviet tanks used in that conflict. Some were supplied to the Koreans as part of the Military Assistance Program and served for years, as did re-engined examples found in Yugoslavia, which operated into the 1990s. Two remained in service with the Republic of China Army at least to 2001.  American soldiers usually referred to them as TDs for 'tank destroyers'. The US Army assigned it the nickname Jackson in 1944, but this name did not see use during the war, and only became popular decades later in the 1970s.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105356;New Heavy Tank Destroyer Design: The T28 105mm Heavy Tank Destroyer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105356;The T28 Super Heavy Tank was an American heavily armored tank self-propelled gun designed for the United States Army during World War II. It was originally designed to be used to break through German defenses of the Siegfried Line, and was later considered as a possible participant in the planned invasion of the Japanese mainland. The 100-ton vehicle was initially designated a heavy tank, it was re-designated as the 105 mm Gun Motor Carriage T95 in 1945, and then renamed in 1946 as the Super Heavy Tank T28.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105357;New Semi-Automatic Rifle Design: The Springfield M14 Semi-Automatic Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105357;M14 rifle, officially the United States Rifle, 7.62 mm, M14, is an American selective fire automatic rifle that fires 7.62×51mm NATO (.308 Winchester) ammunition. It gradually replaced the M1 Garand in U.S. Army service by 1961 and in U.S. Marine Corps service by 1965. It was the standard issue infantry rifle for U.S. military personnel in the contiguous United States, Europe, and South Korea from 1959 until it was replaced by the M16 rifle in 1970. The M14 was used for U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps basic and Advanced Individual Training (AIT) from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s.  The M14 was the last American "battle rifle" (weapons that fire full-power rifle ammunition, such as the 7.62×51 mm) issued in quantity to U.S. military personnel.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105358;New Assault Rifle Design: The M16 Assault Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105358;The M16 rifle, officially designated Rifle, Caliber 5.56 mm, M16, is a United States military adaptation of the ArmaLite AR-15 rifle. The original M16 was a select-fire, 5.56×45mm rifle with a 20-round magazine.  In 1963, the M16 entered United States Military service and was deployed for jungle warfare operations during the Vietnam War. In 1969, the M16A1 replaced the M14 rifle to become the U.S. military's standard service rifle.The M16A1 improvements include a bolt-assist, chromed plated bore and a new 30-round magazine. In 1983, the USMC adopted the M16A2 rifle and the U.S. Army adopted it in 1986. The M16A2 fires the improved 5.56×45mm NATO (M855/SS109) cartridge and has a new adjustable rear sight, case deflector, heavy barrel, improved handguard, pistol grip and buttstock, as well as a semi-auto and three-round burst only fire selector.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105359;New Assault Rifle Design: The Colt CAR-15 Commando Assault Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105359;The Colt Automatic Rifle-15 Military Weapons System or CAR-15 was a family of AR-15 and M16 rifle–based firearms marketed by Colt in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Due to their compact size, the short-barreled Colt Commando and XM177 versions of this family continued to be issued to the U.S. military after the Vietnam War.  The CAR-15 name was an attempt to re-associate the AR-15 name with Colt, since the AR initially stood for ArmaLite Rifle, the original manufacturer. Colt later abandoned the CAR-15 concept, but continued to make variations, using the M16 brand for military-oriented models and the Colt AR-15 brand for law enforcement and civilian models. However, in present usage, CAR-15 is used as a generic name for carbine-length M16 and AR-15 variants from before the M4.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105360;New Rifle Grenade Design: The M203 Grenade Launcher;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105360;The M203 is a single-shot 40 mm under-barrel grenade launcher designed to attach to a rifle. It uses the same rounds as the older stand-alone M79 break-action grenade launcher, which utilizes the High-Low Propulsion System to keep recoil forces low. Though versatile, and compatible with many rifle models, the M203 was originally designed for the U.S. M16 and its variant, the M4 Carbine. The launcher can also be mounted onto a C7, a Canadian version of the M16 rifle, however, this requires the prior removal of the bottom handguard.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105361;New MANPAD Design: The FIM-43 Redeye MANPAD;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105361;The General Dynamics FIM-43 Redeye was a man-portable surface-to-air missile system. It used infrared homing to track its target. Production was terminated in September 1969 after about 85,000 rounds had been built - in anticipation of the Redeye II, which later became the FIM-92 Stinger. The Redeye was withdrawn gradually between 1982 and 1995 as the Stinger was deployed.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105362;New Minigun Design: The M134 Minigun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105362;The M134 Minigun is a 7.62x51 mm NATO, six-barreled machine gun with a high rate of fire (2,000 to 6,000 rounds per minute). It features Gatling-style rotating barrels with an external power source, normally an electric motor. The "Mini" in the name is in comparison to designs that use a similar firing mechanism but larger shells, such as General Electric's earlier 20-millimeter M61 Vulcan, and "gun" for a caliber size smaller than that of a cannon, typically 20 mm and higher.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105363;New Minigun Design: The GAU-17/A Minigun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105363;The General Electric minigun is in use in several branches of the U.S. military, under a number of designations. The basic fixed armament version was given the designation M134 by the United States Army, while the same weapon was designated GAU-2/A (on a fixed mount) and GAU-17/A (flexible mount) by the United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Navy (USN). The USAF minigun variant has three versions, while the US Army weapon appears to have incorporated several improvements without a change in designation.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105364;New Recoilless Rifle Design: The M67 Recoilless Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105364;The M67 recoilless rifle was a 90-mm antitank recoilless rifle made in the United States and later in the Republic of Korea. It could also be employed in an antipersonnel role with the use of the M590 antipersonnel round. It was designed to be fired primarily from the ground using the bipod and monopod, but it could also be fired from the shoulder using the folded bipod as a shoulder rest and the monopod as a front grip. The weapon was air-cooled and breech-loaded, and fired fixed ammunition. It is a direct fire weapon employing stadia lines to allow simple range finding, based on a typical tank target bridging the lines once in range.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105365;New Anti-Tank Rocket Design: The M72 LAW (Light Anti-Armor Weapon);;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105365;The M72 LAW (Light Anti-Tank Weapon, also referred to as the Light Anti-Armor Weapon or LAW as well as LAWS Light Anti-Armor Weapons System) is a portable one-shot 66 mm unguided anti-tank weapon. In early 1963, the M72 LAW was adopted by the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps as their primary individual infantry anti-tank weapon, replacing the M31 HEAT rifle grenade and the M20A1 "Super Bazooka" in the U.S. Army. It was subsequently adopted by the U.S. Air Force to serve in an anti-emplacement/anti-armor role in Air Base Defense duties.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105366;New Automatic Grenade Launcher Design: The Saco Mk 19 Automatic Grenade Launcher;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105366;The Mk 19 grenade launcher (also known as the Mark 19) is an American 40mm belt-fed automatic grenade launcher that was first developed during the Vietnam War. The first model (Mod 0) in 1966 was determined to be unreliable and unsafe, but a total of 6 Mod 1 launchers were successfully tested on U.S. Navy riverine patrol craft in the Mekong Delta in 1972.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9105368;The Stoner 63, also known as the M63, XM22, XM23, XM207 or the Mk 23 Mod 0 machine gun, is an American modular weapons system designed by Eugene Stoner in the early 1960s. Cadillac Gage was the primary manufacturer of the Stoner 63 during its history. Members of the United States military, including Navy SEALs and Marines, used it in very limited numbers during the Vietnam War.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105369;New Light Machine Gun Design: The M60 GPMG Light Machine Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105369;The M60, officially the United States Machine Gun, Caliber 7.62 mm, M60, is a family of American general-purpose machine guns firing 7.62×51mm NATO cartridges from a disintegrating belt of M13 links. There are several types of live ammunition approved for use in the M60, including ball, tracer, and armor-piercing rounds.  Introduced in 1957, it has served with every branch of the U.S. military and still serves with other armed forces.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105370;New Mortar Design: The M29 81mm Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105370;The M29 is an American-produced 81 millimeter mortar. It began replacing the M1 mortar in U.S. service in 1952 being lighter and with greater range. It was subsequently replaced by the M252 mortar in 1987. Variants included the M29E1 and M29A1, adopted in 1964. These were produced with a hard chrome-plated bore to prolong barrel life and ease cleaning.  The maximum rate of fire is 30 rounds for the first minute followed by 4 to 12 rounds per additional minute. The range is 5,140 yards. The weapon was usually serviced by a crew of five. The normal crew consisted of a squad leader, a gunner, an assistant gunner and two ammunition handlers.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105371;New Anti-Tank Rifle Grenade Design: The M31 AT Rifle Grenade;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105371;The M31 HEAT is a fin-stabilized anti-tank rifle grenade designed in the late 1950s to replace the Belgian ENERGA rifle grenade which was adopted by the US Army and US Marines as an emergency stop-gap measure during the Korean War. Like the ENERGA, it has a nose-initiated, based-detonated HEAT warhead, but unlike the ENERGA, the mechanical impact fuse system is replaced with a less complex and more reliable piezo-electric fuse system which also allows higher angles of impact, up to 65 degrees. On impact, the nose cover collapses, crushing a crystal-like material, which sends an electric current through a separate wire to the warhead's detonator, located in the base of the warhead. A mechanical safety, comprising a set back system located in the warhead's base, grounds the firing circuit and prevents the accidental explosion of the warhead. On firing, the sudden launch acceleration causes the set-back's three disks to rotate 90 degrees, each in succession to the other, with the rotation of the third disk removing the grounding after approximately 10 meters of flight and completing a firing circuit for the current to flow from the nose to the detonator in the base. Compared to the ENERGA, the M31 is slightly lighter in weight and has a smaller-diameter warhead—i.e. 75mm vs 66mm. Penetration for the M31 is estimated to be 200 mm / 8 inches for steel armor plating and twice that estimate for concrete. The warhead technology developed for the M31 was used for the future M72 LAW antitank rocket.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105372;New Recoilless Rifle Design: The M40 106mm Recoilless Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105372;The M40 recoilless rifle is a lightweight, portable, crew-served 106 mm weapon intended primarily as an anti-tank weapon made in the United States. The weapon is commonly described as being 106 mm, but it is in fact 105 mm; the 106 mm designation was designed to prevent confusion with the incompatible 105 mm ammunition from the failed M27.It could also be employed in an antipersonnel role with the use of the antipersonnel-tracer flechette round. It can be fired primarily from a wheeled ground mount. The air-cooled, breech-loaded, single-shot rifle fired fixed ammunition. It was designed for direct firing only, and sighting equipment for this purpose was furnished with each weapon.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105373;New Light Howitzer Design: The M102 105mm Light Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105373;The M102 105mm howitzer is used in air mobile (helicopter) and light infantry operations. The weapon carriage is lightweight welded aluminum, mounted on a variable recoil mechanism. The weapon is manually loaded and positioned, and can be towed by a 2 ton truck or High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), can be transported by UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, or can be dropped by parachute with airborne units. When emplaced, the howitzer's high volume of fire compensates in large measure for the lower explosive weight of the projectile compared to the Army's 155 mm and 8-inch howitzers. Since 1964, the Army has acquired 1,150 M102 towed howitzers.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105374;New Self-Propelled Howitzer Design: The T92 240mm HMC Self-Propelled Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105374;The 240 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage T92 was a self-propelled howitzer developed by the United States of America during World War II. The same mounting with the 8-inch Gun M1 was developed as the T93. Neither were built in significant numbers and the war ended before they could be used.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105375;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The M108 105mm SP Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105375;The M108 Howitzer is an American self-propelled 105 mm howitzer, first introduced in the early 1960s.  The M108 was powered by a Detroit Diesel turbocharged 8V-71T 8-cylinders 405 hp engine. It used the same hull and turret as the 155 mm M109 self-propelled howitzer, and components of the M113 armored vehicle. The M108 was phased out soon after the American intervention in the Vietnam War, as the M109's 155 mm calibre was considered better fitted for the modern war.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105376;New Self-Propelled Howitzer Design: The M44 155mm SP Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105376;The M44 was an American-made self-propelled 155 mm howitzer, first introduced in the early 1950s.  Towards the end of the Korean War the US Army replaced the M41 155mm Howitzer Motor Carriage with the M44 which used the drive train of the recently introduced M-41 light tank, giving it increased battlefield mobility and gave the 155mm cannon crew some armor protection, even when firing the cannon. The 155mm cannon was a version of the M114 designated the M45 Howitzer with a modified recoil system that was more compact and put all the cannon under armor except the top and the barrel. The first production models were issued in 1954.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105377;New Self-Propelled Howitzer Design: The M52 105mm SP Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105377;Production of M52 (armed with a 105mm main gun) started in 1951, but problems with the design prevented its immediate deployment. M52 was finally issued in 1955. The total crew consisted of eight men, but when travelling three crew having to ride in an ammunition support vehicle. The vehicle was replaced from 1963 onwards by (what was at the time) the new M108 SPG.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105378;New Self-Propelled Howitzer Design: The M53 155mm SP Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105378;The M53 155mm Self-Propelled Gun is the sister vehicle to the M-55 8-inch Self-Propelled Howitzer, differing almost entirely in the mounted gun and a few other details. Both were manufactured by Pacific Car and Foundry based on the M46, M47 and M48 Patton tanks. The M53 155mm gun tube is longer and thinner than the tube of the 8-inch howitzer mounted on the M55, the main way to visually distinguish the two models. The M53 155mm SP Gun was known as the T97 in prototype.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105379;New Self-Propelled Howitzer Design: The M55 203mm SP Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105379;The M55 was essentially a 155mm self-propelled gun M53 rearmed with an 8" [203mm] howitzer. The M55 used components of the M48 Patton tank, but the automotive aspects were reversed. The engine was mounted in the front and drove through a front-drive sprocket. The driver's cupola is visible on the front left of the turret, and spare track blocks were stored on the turret front.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105380;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The M107 175mm SP Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105380;The M107 175 mm self-propelled gun was used by the U.S. Army from the early 1960s through to the late 1970s. It was part of a family of self-propelled artillery that also included the M110. It was intended to provide long-range fire support in an air-transportable system. It was exported to several other countries including Germany, South Korea, Spain, Greece, Iran, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Turkey. The M107's combat history in U.S. service was limited to the Vietnam War; it also saw extensive combat use in Israeli service. The M107 was the last self-propelled gun (high velocity, low trajectory, long range) in the U.S. Army inventory. It shared many components with, and in many cases was replaced by, later versions of the M110.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105381;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The M110 203mm SP Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105381;Development of the M110 self-propelled howitzer began in mid-1950s. The first prototype, known as the T-236, was built in 1959. The M110 entered service with the US Army and US Marine Corps in 1961. It was produced for a long period of time and was exported to a number of countries. The M110 was the most powerful self-propelled howitzer in service with the US Army.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105382;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The M109 155mm SP Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105382;The M109 is an American 155mm self-propelled howitzer, first introduced in the early 1960s. It has been upgraded a number of times, most recently to the M109A7. The M109 family is the most common Western indirect-fire support weapon of maneuver brigades of armored and mechanized infantry divisions.  The M109 has a crew of six: the section chief, the driver, the gunner, the assistant gunner and two ammunition handlers. The gunner aims the cannon left or right (deflection), the assistant gunner aims the cannon up and down (quadrant). The M109A6 Paladin needs only a crew of four: the commander, driver, gunner and an ammunition loader.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105383;New Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun Design: The M42 Duster SP Anti-Aircraft Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105383;The M42 40 mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun, or "Duster," is an armored light air-defense gun built for the U.S. Army from 1952 until December 1959. Production of this vehicle was performed by the tank division of the General Motors Corporation. It used components from the M41 light tank and was constructed of all welded steel.  A total of 3,700 M42s were built. The vehicle has a crew of six and weighs 22,500 kg (49,500 lb) fully loaded. Maximum speed is 45 mph with a range of 100 miles. Armament consists of fully automatic twin 40 mm M2A1 Bofors, with a rate of fire of 2x120 rounds per minute (rpm) and either a .30 caliber Browning M1919A4 or 7.62mm M60 machine gun. The 500 hp, six-cylinder, Continental (or Lycoming Engines), air-cooled, gasoline engine is located in the rear of the vehicle. It was driven by a cross-drive, 2-speed Allison transmission.  Although the M42 Duster was initially designed for an anti-aircraft role, it proved highly successful when used in the Vietnam War against unarmored ground forces.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105384;New Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun Design: The M163 Vulcan Air Defense System (VADS) AA Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105384;The M163 Vulcan Air Defense System (VADS) is a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG) that was used by the United States Army. The M168 gun is a variant of the General Dynamics 20 mm M61 Vulcan rotary cannon, the standard cannon in most U.S. combat aircraft since the 1960s, mounted on either an armored vehicle or a trailer.  The weapon is mounted on a modified M113 vehicle (the M741 carrier). The system was designed to complement the M48 Chaparral missile system. The M163 uses a small, range-only radar, the AN/VPS-2, and an M61 optical lead-calculating sight. The system is suitable for night operations with the use of AN/PVS series night vision sights that can be mounted to the right side of the primary sight.  The gun fires at 3,000 rounds per minute in short bursts of 10, 30, 60, or 100 rounds, or it can fire in continuous fire mode at a rate of 1,000 rounds per minute. A linkless feed system is used.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105385;New Amphibious APC Design: The LVTP-5 Amphibious Armored Personnel Carrier;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105385;The LVTP-5 (Landing Vehicle, Tracked, Personnel) was a family of amphibious armored fighting vehicles used by the United States Marine Corps. It was designed by the BorgWarner company and built by FMC (Food Machinery Corporation) along with a few other companies. It was first accepted into service in 1956. Some 1,124 basic units were produced, plus the specialist variants, and many saw action in the Vietnam War.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105386;New Armored Personnel Carrier Design: The M59 Armored Personnel Carrier;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105386;The M59 was an American armored personnel carrier that entered service in the spring of 1954 replacing the M75. It had three key advantages over the M75: it was amphibious, had a lower profile, and was considerably cheaper to produce. Production ended in 1960, by which time approximately 6,300 had been built. The M84 Mortar Carrier was a derivative of the M59.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105387;New Armored Personnel Carrier Design: The M75 Armored Personnel Carrier;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105387;The M75 Armored Infantry Vehicle is an American armored personnel carrier that was produced between December 1952 and February 1954, and saw service in the Korean War. It was replaced in U.S. service by the smaller, cheaper, amphibious M59. The M75s were given as military aid to Belgium, where they were used until the early 1980s. 1,729 M75s were built before production was halted.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105388;New Armored Personnel Carrier Design: The M113 Armored Personnel Carrier;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105388;The M113 is a fully tracked armored personnel carrier that was developed by Food Machinery Corp (FMC). The vehicle was first fielded by the United States Army's mechanized infantry units in Vietnam in April 1962. The M113 was the most widely used armored vehicle of the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War, earning the nickname 'Green Dragon' by the Viet Cong as it was used to break through heavy thickets in the midst of the jungle to attack and overrun enemy positions. It was largely known as an APC or an ACAV (armored cavalry assault vehicle) by the allied forces.  The M113 introduced new aluminum armor that made the vehicle much lighter than earlier vehicles; it was thick enough to protect the crew and passengers against small arms fire but light enough that the vehicle was air transportable and moderately amphibious.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105389;New Light Tank Design: The M41 Bulldog Light Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105389;The M41 Walker Bulldog was a U.S. light tank developed to replace the M24 Chaffee. It was named for General Walton Walker who died in a jeep accident in Korea. On 7 November 1950, the US Ordnance Committee Minutes (OCM) issued item #33476, redesignating the heavy, medium, and light tank, according to the armament, the 120mm (heavy) Gun Tanks, 90mm (medium) Gun Tanks, and the 76mm (light) Gun tanks.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105390;New Light Tank Design: The M551 Sheridan Armored Recon Airborne Assault Vehicle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105390;The M551 "Sheridan" AR/AAV (Armored Reconnaissance/Airborne Assault Vehicle) was a light tank developed by the United States and named after Civil War General Philip Sheridan. It was designed to be landed by parachute and to swim across rivers. It was armed with the technically advanced but troublesome M81/M81 Modified/M81E1 152mm gun/launcher,which fired conventional ammunition and the MGM-51 Shillelagh guided anti-tank missile.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105391;New Main Battle Tank Design: The M46 Patton I Main Battle Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105391;The M46 was an American tank designed to replace the M26 Pershing and M4 Sherman. It was one of the U.S Army's principal medium tanks of the early Cold War, with models in service from 1949 to the mid-1950s. It was not widely used by U.S. Cold War allies, being exported only to Belgium, and only in small numbers to train crews on the upcoming M47 Patton.  The M46 was the first tank to be named after General George S. Patton Jr., commander of the U.S. Third Army during World War II and one of the earliest American advocates for the use of tanks in battle.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105392;New Main Battle Tank Design: The M47 Patton II Main Battle Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105392;The M47 Patton is an American tank, the second tank to be named after General George S. Patton, commander of the U.S. Third Army during World War II and one of the earliest American advocates of tanks in battle. It was a development of the M46 Patton tank. The M47 was the U.S. Army's and Marine Corps' primary tank, intended to replace the M46 Patton and M4 Sherman medium tanks. The M47 was widely used by U.S. Cold War allies, both SEATO and NATO countries, and was the only Patton series tank that never saw combat while in US service.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105393;New Main Battle Tank Design: The M48 Patton III Main Battle Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105393;The M48 Patton is a main battle tank that was designed in the United States. It was the third tank to be officially named after General George S. Patton, commander of the U.S. Third Army during World War II and one of the earliest American advocates for the use of tanks in battle. It was a further development of the M47 Patton tank. The M48 Patton was in U.S. service until replaced by the M60. The M48 served as the U.S. Army and Marine Corps's primary battle tank in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. It was widely used by U.S. Cold War allies, especially other NATO countries.  The M48 Patton tank was designed to replace the previous M47 Pattons and M4 Shermans. Although largely resembling the M47, the M48 Patton was a completely new tank design. Some M48A5 models served well into the 1980s with American forces, and many M48 Patton models remain in service in other countries. The M48 was the last U.S. tank to mount the 90 mm tank gun, with the last model, the M48A5, being upgraded to carry the new standard weapon of the M60, the 105mm gun.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105394;New Main Battle Tank Design: The M60 Patton IV Main Battle Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105394;The M60 Patton is a main battle tank (MBT) introduced in December 1960. With the United States Army's deactivation of their last (M103) heavy tank battalion in 1963, the M60 became the Army's primary tank during the Cold War. Although developed from the M48 Patton, the M60 series was never officially classified as a Patton tank, but as a "product-improved descendant" of the Patton series. In March 1959, the tank was officially standardized as the 105 mm Gun Full Tracked Combat Tank M60.  The M60 underwent many updates over its service life. The interior layout, based on the design of the M48, provided ample room for updates and improvements, extending the vehicle's service life for over four decades. It was widely used by the U.S. and its Cold War allies, especially those in NATO, and remains in service throughout the world today, despite having been superseded by the M1 Abrams in the U.S. military.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105395;New Heavy Tank Design: The M103 120mm Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105395;The M103 (officially designated 120mm Gun Combat Tank M103) served the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps during the Cold War. Until the development of the M1 Abrams in the mid-1970s, it was the heaviest and most heavily armed tank in US service. The M103 was manufactured at the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant and the first units were accepted in 1957. The last M103s were withdrawn from service in 1974. Like the contemporary British Conqueror tank, the M103 was designed to counter Soviet heavy tanks, such as the Joseph Stalin tank or the T-10 if a conventional World War III broke out. Its long-ranged 120 mm cannon was designed to hit enemy tanks at extreme distances. In 1953–54 a series of 300 tanks, initially designated T43E1, were built by Chrysler at the Newark plant. Testing was unsatisfactory; the tanks failing to meet Continental Army Command's standards and the tanks were put into storage in August 1955. After 98 improvement modifications were approved, on 26 April, 1956 the tank was designated the M103 Heavy Tank. Of the 300 T43E1s built, 80 went to the US Army (74 of which were rebuilt to M103 standard), and 220 were accepted by the US Marine Corps, to be used as infantry support, rebuilt to improved M103A1, then M103A2 standards.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105396;New Tank Destroyer Design: The M50 Ontos (Thing) Tank Destroyer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105396;The Ontos, officially the Rifle, Multiple 106 mm, Self-propelled, M50, was a U.S. light armored tracked anti-tank vehicle developed in the 1950s, a fast tank killer for airborne forces.  It mounted six M40 106 mm recoilless rifles as its main armament, which could be fired in rapid succession against single targets to guarantee a kill. It was produced in limited numbers for the U.S. Marines after the U.S. Army lost interest in the project. The Marines consistently reported excellent results when they used the Ontos for direct fire support against infantry in numerous battles and operations during the Vietnam War. The American stock of Ontos was largely expended towards the end of the conflict and the Ontos was removed from service in 1969.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105397;New Tank Destroyer Design: The M56 Scorpion 90mm Airborne Tank Destroyer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105397;The M56 Scorpion was an unarmored American self-propelled anti-tank gun, which featured a 90mm M54 gun with a simple blast shield, and unprotected crew compartment. It was meant to be transported by helicopter or by air drop.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105399;New Medium Tank Design: The M4 Sherman VC Firefly Medium Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105399;The Sherman Firefly was a tank used by the United Kingdom in World War II. It was based on the US M4 Sherman but fitted with the powerful 3-inch (76.2 mm) calibre British 17-pounder anti-tank gun as its main weapon. Originally conceived as a stopgap until future British tank designs came into service, the Sherman Firefly became the most common vehicle with the 17-pounder in the war.  Though the British expected to have their own new tank models developed soon, British Major George Brighty championed the already-rejected idea of mounting the 17-pounder in the existing Sherman. With the help of Lieutenant Colonel Witheridge and despite official disapproval, he managed to get the concept accepted. This proved fortunate, as both the Challenger and Cromwell tank designs experienced difficulties and delays.  After the problem of getting the gun to fit in the Sherman's turret was solved, the Firefly was put into production in early 1944, in time to equip Field Marshal Montgomery's 21st Army Group for the Normandy landings. It soon became highly valued as the only British tank capable of defeating the Panther and Tiger tanks it faced in Normandy at long range. In recognition of this, German tank and anti-tank gun crews were instructed to attack Fireflies first. Between 2,100 and 2,200 were manufactured before production wound down in 1945.;;;;;;;;;;x
