EVTNAME9106300;New Bolt Action Rifle Design: The Swedish Mauser m/1894 Carbine.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106300;The m/1894 carbine was adopted in 1894 with the first 12,000 carbines being manufactured by Waffenfabrik Mauser in Oberndorf am Neckar, Germany.  Mauser produced 12,000 m/1894 carbines between 1894 and 1896 and Carl Gustafs Stads Gevarsfaktori 115,000 m/1894 carbines between 1895 and 1933, giving a total of 127,000 m/1894 carbines.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106301;New Bolt Action Rifle Design: The Swedish Mauser m/1896 Long Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106301;The Model 1896 rifle in 6.5x55mm was adopted in 1896 for infantry use, replacing the Model 1867–1889 Remington rolling block rifle in 8x58mmR Danish Krag. Swedish production (under license) started in 1898 at Carl Gustafs, but additional rifles were produced by Mauser during 1899 and 1900 because of delays in shipping additional production machinery from Germany to Sweden.  Standard production at Carl Gustafs continued until 1925, but approximately 18,000 m/96 rifles were manufactured by Husqvarna Vapenfabriks AB during World War II for civilian marksmanship training.  Mauser produced 40,000 m/1896 long rifles between 1895 and 1900, Carl Gustafs Stads Gevarsfaktori 475,000 m/1896 between 1896 and 1932 and Husqvarna Vapenfabriks AB 20,000 m/1896 between 1942 and 1944. Giving a total of 535,000 m/96 long rifles.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106302;New Bolt Action Rifle Design: The Swedish Mauser m/1938 Short Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106302;The Model 1938 rifle was adopted in 1938 as part of a worldwide trend (which began just before World War I) towards service rifles that were shorter in overall length than a standard infantry rifle, but longer than a cavalry carbine. Contemporary examples such as the Mauser Karabiner 98k, Short Magazine Lee–Enfield No I Mk III, MAS-36, and M1903 Springfield were all noticeably shorter than a standard late 19th century infantry rifle, and with another war on the horizon the Swedes felt it would be expedient to adopt a shorter rifle for use by mechanized troops and the Navy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106303;New Light Machine Gun Design: The Karl Gustav m/21-m37 Light Machine Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106303;The m37 Light Machine Gun was basically a copy of the American M917 Browning Assault Rifle (BAR) and was produced in Sweden before the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106304;New Recoilless Rifle Design: The Karl Gustav 84mm Recoilless Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106304;The Carl Gustaf, also known as, Gustaf Bazooka and M2CG is an 84 mm man-portable reusable anti-tank recoilless rifle produced by Saab Bofors Dynamics (formerly Bofors Anti-Armour AB) in Sweden. The first prototype of the Carl Gustaf was produced in 1946, and while similar weapons of the era have generally disappeared, the Carl Gustaf remains in widespread use today.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106305;New Semi-Automatic Rifle Design: The Karl Gustav m/42;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106305;The Automatgevar m/42 (Ag m/42, outside of Sweden commonly known as the AG42, AG-42 or Ljungman) is a Swedish semi-automatic rifle which saw limited use by the Swedish Army from 1942 until the 1960s.  It turned out to be not a very reliable weapon and was manufactured in very small quantities historically.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106306;New Submachinegun Design: The Karl Gustav m/45;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106306;Kulsprutepistol m/45 (Kpist m/45), also known as the Carl Gustav M/45 and the Swedish K SMG, is a 9x19mm Swedish submachine gun designed by Gunnar Johnsson, adopted in 1945 (hence the m/45 designation), and manufactured at the Carl Gustafs Stads Gevarsfaktori in Eskilstuna, Sweden. The m/45 was the standard submachine gun of the Swedish Army from 1945 to 1965. It was gradually replaced in Swedish service by updated Ak 4 and Ak 5 assault rifles.  The m/45 SMG was developed in 1944–45, with a design borrowing from and also improving on many design elements of earlier submachine guns. The sheet metal stamping techniques used in making the German MP 40, the British Sten, and the Soviet PPSh-41 and PPS-43 were studied in detail. Two designs were tested in 1944, one from Carl Gustafs Stads Gevarsfaktori and one from Husqvarna Vapenfabrik AB and the prototype from Carl Gustafs Stads Gevarsfaktori was chosen for further development. The first production version was adopted in 1945 as the Kpist m/45.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106307;New Light Machine Gun Design: The Karl Gustav m/40;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106307;The Kg m/40 was a light machine gun used by the Swedish Army during the 1940s. A small number were also manufactured in Germany by Knorr-Bremse for the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS, under the name MG35/36A, though they were mostly nicknamed "the Knorr-Bremse".  The KG/1940 loaded its magazine from the side, similar to the FG42. It also had the ability to use 20 round magazines from Swedish type M1918 BARs. In 1940 there was a desperate need for machineguns in Sweden. The production rate of kg m/37 (Swedish BAR variant) was rather slow and not suitable for modern production.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106308;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The 37mm Bofors;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106308;The Bofors 37 mm gun was an anti-tank gun designed by Swedish manufacturer Bofors in the early 1930s. Licensed copies were produced in a number of countries. The gun was used by some European armies during World War II, mainly at the early stage of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106309;New Anti-Aircraft Gun Design: The 40mm Bofors;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106309;The Bofors 40 mm gun, often referred to simply as the Bofors gun, is an anti-aircraft/multi-purpose autocannon designed in the 1930s by the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors. It was one of the most popular medium-weight anti-aircraft systems during World War II, used by most of the western Allies as well as by the Axis powers. A small number of these weapons remains in service to this day, and saw action as late as the Gulf War.  In the post-war era the original design was not suitable for action against jet powered aircraft, so Bofors introduced a new model of significantly more power, the 40 mm L/70. In spite of sharing almost nothing with the original design other than the calibre and the distinctive conical flash hider, this weapon is also widely known simply as "the Bofors". Although not as popular as the original L/60 model, the L/70 remains in service to this day, especially as a multi-purpose weapon for light armored vehicles, as on the CV 90.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106310;New Heavy Field Gun Design: The 105mm Kanon m/34;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106310;The 105mm Cannon Model 1934 was a heavy field gun used by the Netherlands and Hungary during World War II. Dutch guns were known as the 10-veld. Hungary purchased a license and built them as the 31 M from Sweden.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106311;New Howitzer Gun Design: The Haubits m/40 105mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106311;The 105mm Haubits m/40 is a Swedish 105 mm howitzer, which was manufactured by Bofors during World War II..;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106312;New SP Artillery Design: The Stormartillerivagn m/43 SP Artillery;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106312;Stormartillerivagn m/43 (Sav m/43) was an assault gun based on Stridsvagn m/41 SII chassis, a Swedish development of a license-built Czech TNH medium tank. The Sav m/43 was first armed with a 75 mm gun, later they were rearmed with a 105 mm m/44 gun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106313;New SP Anti-Air Design: The L-62 Anti II;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106313;Luftvarnskanonvagn L-62 anti II, also known as Landsverk anti-II or L-62 or locally ItPsv 41, was a Swedish self-propelled anti-aircraft gun that was developed specifically for Finland between 1941 and 1942. The vehicle was developed from the Toldi L-60 m/38 tank. The chassis was lengthened and an 40 mm Bofors AA-gun added. The gun was called 40 ItK/38 in Finnish service.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106314;New Light Tank Design: The Stridsvagn m/21;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106314;Stridsvagn m/21 (Strv m/21) was a Swedish development on the German World War I tank prototype LK II.  It was powered by a sleeve valve type engine located in the front, the driver and crew being in the rear. The suspension and running gear was protected by armored skirts. Ten of these tanks were built and were armed with a single 6.5 mm machine gun.  The Strv m/21-29 was an upgraded version of the m/21. The modifications included a more powerful engine and heavier armor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106315;New Light Tank Design: The Stridsvagn L-60;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106315;Stridsvagn L-60 (Strv L-60), also known as Landsverk L-60, was a Swedish tank developed in 1934. It was developed by AB Landsverk as a light tank which included several design features later adopted by Germany, Hungary, and Russia in their tank designs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106316;New Light Tank Design: The Stridsvagn m/40;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106316;The Stridsvagn Strv m/40 light tank became the first Swedish-designed combat tank to see quantitative production.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106317;New Medium Tank Design: The Stridsvagn m/31 L-10;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106317;Stridsvagn m/31 (Landsverk L-10) was a Swedish World War II era tank built by AB Landsverk. It was armed with a 37 mm Bofors gun and a light machine gun, and was equipped with 8–24 mm armor. Only three were built and, despite being highly advanced for the time when World War II broke out, they were dug in as static bunkers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106318;New Medium Tank Design: The Stridsvagn m/42;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106318;Stridsvagn m/42 (Strv m/42) was Swedish medium tank of World War II. Known by its manufacturer AB Landsverk as Lago II-III-IV, it fielded a 75 mm L/34 gun, the first of its size in a Swedish tank. It entered service with the Swedish army in November 1941. Modern in design it was also well protected and mobile. A total of 282 were produced.  As a neutral nation in World War II Sweden did not engage in combat, thus its tanks have no battlefield record.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106319;New Main Battle Tank Design: The Stridsvagn 74;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106319;Stridsvagn 74 (strv 74) was a Swedish tank in use with the Swedish Army from 1958 to 1984. It was a modification of the older stridsvagn m/42 which was phased out of service in the 1950s. Instead of scrapping the vehicles altogether, the chassis were used to build a new tank which could be used as a supplement to the newly bought stridsvagn 101. The turret of strv 74 was completely new, with a 75 mm high-velocity gun based on an old anti-aircraft gun, engines and transmission were modified or changed from the strv m/42, broader tracks and a separate electrical engine for the turret rotation was introduced while retaining the manual control as a backup.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106320;New Main Battle Tank Design: The Stridsvagn 104;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106320;The Stridsvagen Strv 104 Main Battle Tank was the Swedish Army version of the British Centurion in service during the Cold War decades.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
