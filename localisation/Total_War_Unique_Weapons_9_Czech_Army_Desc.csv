EVTNAME9106400;New Bolt Action Rifle Design: The Ceska Zbrojovka vz. 24;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106400;The vz. 24 rifle is a bolt-action carbine designed and produced in Czechoslovakia from 1924 to 1942. It was developed from the Mauser Gewehr 98 line, and features a very similar bolt design. The rifle was designed in Czechoslovakia shortly after World War I, featuring a 600mm  barrel which was shorter and considered more handy than the 150mm -longer Gewehr 98. The carbine followed a similar trend in weapon design at the time, that a short rifle gave away little in ballistic efficiency at combat ranges, but was easier to handle on account of its shorter length.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106401;New Semi-Automatic Rifle Design: The ZH-29;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106401;The ZH-29 was a semi-automatic rifle developed in Czechoslovakia during the late 1920s.  The ZH-29 is a gas-operated service rifle with a locking system similar to that which would be later used in the Sturmgewehr 44. The most distinctive feature is that the barrel is offset at a slight angle to the receiver. The rifle uses an aluminum barrel jacket.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106402;New Light Machine Gun Design: The Ceska Zbrojovka vz. 30;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106402;The ZB-30 and ZB-30J were the later versions of the famous Czechoslovak machine gun, the ZB-26. However, the ZB-30 had some design differences, making it similar to the later ZGB-33, which was an early prototype of the Bren gun. Like the ZB-26, the Wehrmacht adopted the ZB-30 after the occupation of Czechoslovakia, renaming it the MG30(t), it was used in the same role as the MG34, as a light machine gun. In the opening phases of World War II, the ZB-30 in 7.92 mm Mauser caliber was used in large numbers by elements of the German Waffen SS, who did not initially have full access to standard Wehrmacht supply channels.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106403;New Submachine Gun Design: The Ceska Zbrojovka ZK-383;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106403;The ZK-383 is a submachine gun and was developed by the Kouck√Ω brothers who worked at the pre-war Ceskoslovenska zbrojovka, akc.spol. (under its name of Zbrojovka Brno after World War II) arms factory in Brno Czechoslovakia. It was produced at a slow rate from 1938 onwards and was exported as far as South America, to Bolivia and Venezuela.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106404;New Howitzer Design: The Skoda vz. 30 100mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106404;The 10 cm houfnice vz. 30 (howitzer model 30) was a Czechoslovak howitzer used in the Second World War. The 158 weapons captured after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 were taken into Wehrmacht service as the 10 cm leFH 30(t). It was used by a variety of German units during World War II, including II. and III./SS-Artillerie-Abteilung 3 between 1939 and 1940 and SS-Artillerie-Abteilung 51 during 1941.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106405;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The Skoda vz. 36 47mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106405;The 47mm KPUV vz. 36 was an anti-tank gun produced by the Skoda Works that saw service in World War II. Originally designed for the Czechoslovak Army, some were also sold to Yugoslavia. A number were appropriated by the Germans after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939 and used under the designations 47mm Pak(t) or Pak 36(t). The Germans continued it in production and mounted it on the Panzerkampfwagen I chassis as the Panzerjager I tank destroyer. A similar attempt to mount it on the chassis of captured Renault R-35 tanks was less successful.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106406;New Field Gun Design: The Skoda vz. 30 76.5mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106406;The 76mm kanon vz. 30 (Cannon model 30) was a Czech field gun used in the Second World War. Guns captured after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 were taken into Wehrmacht service as the 76mm FK 30(t). It was used by a variety of German units during World War II, including I./SS-Artillerie-Abteilung 3 between 1939 and 1940.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106407;New Light Tank Design: The LT vz 35/PzKpfW 35(t);;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106407;The Panzerkampfwagen 35(t), commonly shortened to Panzer 35(t) or abbreviated as Pz.Kpfw. 35(t), was a Czechoslovak-designed light tank used mainly by Nazi Germany during World War II. The letter (t) stood for tschechisch (German: "Czech"). In Czechoslovak service it had the formal designation Lehku tank vzor 35 (Light Tank Model 35), but was commonly referred to as the LT vz. 35 or LT-35. Four hundred and thirty-four were built; of these the Germans seized two hundred and forty-four when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939 and the Slovaks acquired fifty-two when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time. Others were exported to Bulgaria and Romania. In German service it saw combat during the early years of World War II, notably the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France and the invasion of the Soviet Union before being retired or sold off in 1942.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106408;New Light Tank Design: The LT vz 38/PzKpfW 38(t);;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106408;The Panzerkampfwagen 38(t) was originally a Czech tank of pre-World War II design. After Czechoslovakia was taken over by Germany, it was adopted by the German Army, seeing service in the invasions of Poland, France and Russia. Production ended in 1942, when its armament was deemed inadequate. In all, over 1400 were manufactured. The chassis continued to be produced for the Marder III (1942-1944) with some of its components used in the later Jagdpanzer 38 (1944-1945) tank destroyers, turretless assault guns, anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft guns.;;;;;;;;;;x
