EVTNAME9105200;New Rifle Design: The Arisaka Type 38;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105200;The Type 38 rifle Arisaka was a bolt-action rifle that supplemented the Type 99 Japanese standard infantry rifle during the Second World War. The design was adopted by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1905 (the 38th year of the Meiji period, hence "Type 38") and served from then until the end of 1945.  By 1940 more than three million Type 38s had been issued to the Imperial Japanese Army. However, shortcomings in the Type 38 design during the Second Sino-Japanese War led to the introduction of a further generation of rifles, designated the Type 99 rifle from 1939. This new rifle used the more powerful 7.7×58mm Arisaka cartridge already in use with the Type 92 heavy machine gun and the Type 97 light machine gun. However, not all units received the new weapon, and the mixture of types with incompatible cartridges led to considerable logistics issues during World War II.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105201;New Rifle Design: The Arisaka Type 44 Cavalry Carbine;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105201;Developed from the Type 38 carbine to provide a cavalryman a carbine with a bayonet and not be encumbered with weapons as before the trooper was required to have a Type 32 cavalry saber, a Type 38 carbine and a bayonet. It entered production in 1911 and entered service in 1912 (the 44th year of the Meiji period, hence "Type 44"), and served on until the end of the Second World War in 1945, production of the rifle ran until three years prior to the end of the Second World War; 1942. Approximately 91,900 Type 44 rifles were produced by Japanese arsenals during these years.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105202;New Rifle Design: The Arisaka Type 99 Bolt-Action Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105202;During the Second Sino-Japanese War in the 1930s, the Japanese soon found that the 7.7mm cartridge being fired by their Type 92 heavy machine gun in China was superior to the 6.5×50mm cartridge of the Type 38 rifle, necessitating the development of a new weapon to replace the outclassed Type 38. The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) developed the Type 99 based on the Type 38 rifle but with a caliber of 7.7mm. The Type 99 was produced at nine different arsenals. Seven arsenals were located in Japan, with the other two located at Mukden in China and Jinsen in Korea. The IJA had intended to completely replace the Type 38 with the Type 99 by the end of the war. However, the outbreak of the Pacific war never allowed the army to completely replace the Type 38 and so the IJA used both rifles during the war. As the war progressed, more and more cost saving steps were introduced in order to speed up production.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105203;New Light Machine Gun Design: The Type 11 Light Machine Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105203;Combat experience in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 had convinced the Japanese of the utility of machine guns to provide covering fire for advancing infantry. This was reinforced by the first-hand observations of European combat tactics by Japanese military attachés during the First World War, and the Army Technical Bureau was tasked with the development of a lightweight machine gun, which could be easily transportable by an infantry squad. The resultant “Type 11 light machine gun” (named after the 11th year of the reign of Emperor Taishō, or 1922) was the first light machine gun to be mass-produced in Japan and the oldest Japanese light machine gun design to see service in the Pacific War. It was superseded by the Type 96 light machine gun in 1936.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105204;New Rifle Grenade Design: The Type 2 Rifle Grenade;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105204;The Type 2 rifle grenade launcher was an attachment for the Japanese Type 38 and Type 99 rifles that allowed them to fire special hollow charge grenades. It was a version of the German Schiessbecher grenade launcher. Two grenades were produced for the launcher: a 30 mm calibre grenade and a larger 40 mm calibre grenade, both designated Type 2. The launcher sits over the end of the barrel, held in place with a clamping device. A special crimped blank cartridge or wooden bullet is used to fire the grenades.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105205;New Heavy Machine Gun Design: The Type 92 Shiki Kikanju Heavy Machine Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105205;Essentially a copy of the shroudless post-WWI aircraft-mounted version of the British Lewis gun, the Type 92 was fed with a drum magazine and used in a flexible mount. It was chambered in a Japanese copy of the .303 British cartridge. The main external difference between the two models was the trigger guard, and cooling fins around the barrel and gas piston tube.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105206;New Light Machine Gun Design: The Type 96 Light Machine Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105206;Combat experience in the Manchurian Incident of 1931 and subsequent actions in Manchuria and northern China reaffirmed the Japanese army of the utility of machine guns to provide covering fire for advancing infantry. The earlier Type 11 Light Machine Gun was a lightweight machine gun, which could be easily transportable by an infantry squad into combat. However, the open hopper design of the Type 11 allowed dust and grit to enter into the gun, which was liable to jam in muddy or dirty conditions due to issues with poor dimensional tolerances. This gave the weapon a bad reputation with Japanese troops, and led to calls for its redesign. The Army’s Kokura Arsenal tested the Czech ZB vz. 26 machine gun, samples of which had been captured from the National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China, and (after borrowing certain elements) issued a new design, designated the Type 96 light machine gun, in 1936. The gun was produced at Kokura, Nagoya Arsenal and Mukden with total production about 41,000. While the Japanese design was completely different internally it did resemble the Vz26 in its basic layout using the top feed magazine and a bipod mount.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105207;New Light Machine Gun Design: The Type 99 Light Machine Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105207;The Type 99 was basically the same design as the Type 96 light machine gun, and had a number of parts in common. However, it dispensed with the oiler and had better primary extraction, increasing reliability over its predecessors. Early models had a mono-pod at the stock and a flash suppressor on the muzzle, which was screwed onto a threaded portion of the gun barrel. A top-mounted curved detachable box magazine held 30 rounds, and the finned gun barrel could be rapidly changed to avoid overheating.  The Type 99 had a blade front sight and a leaf rear sight, with graduations from 200 to 1,500 meters, with a wind adjustment. A 2.5X telescopic sight with a 10 degree field of view could be attached at the right side of the gun.[3] These were often issued to the best marksmen of the unit and occasionally employed like a sniper rifle. A standard infantry bayonet could be attached to the gas block below the barrel, but on the battlefield this feature proved inconsequential due to the weight of the gun and the fact that the blade was largely obstructed by the flash hider when it was fixed on the muzzle.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105208;New Heavy Mortar Design: The Type 94 90mm Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105208;By giving the Type 94 an especially heavy and stable mount and bipod, a massive shock absorber group, a powerful projectile, and a lengthy tube and heavy powder charge capacity for long range, Japanese designers intended the weapon to serve as a substitute field or artillery piece that could be hauled in pieces to remote locations, a useful attribute for an army short on transport as well as modern towed large-caliber field howitzers and artillery. The Type 94 had a range of some 4000 yards.  Due to the weight and size of the weapon it was not a weapon that could be moved very easily on a dynamic front therefore it was best suited to defense, but it's power 90mm shell could do a lot of damage.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105209;New Mortar Design: The Type 97 50mm Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105209;The Type 97 81 mm infantry mortar was a Japanese mortar used primary by Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. The Type 97 designation was given to this gun as it was accepted in the year 2597 of the Japanese calendar (1937). It entered service in 1937. Japanese infantry units often are equipped with 81-mm mortars. The Type 97 81 mm mortar is very commonly used and is referred to by the Japanese as an "Infantry Gun". which breaks down into 3 sections for transport. The markings which appear on the base of the barrel read "97 model small trench mortar.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105210;New Anti-Tank Rifle Design: The Type 97 Anti-Tank Rifle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105210;The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) had found itself in need of an effective antitank defence for its infantrymen during the numerous border clashes with the Red Army along the Manchurian border in the mid 1930s. Originally designed to take on the Soviet BT and T26 series of Red Army tanks, The Model (Type) 97 was accepted into service in 1937 and production began in 1938 by the Kokura Arsenal. Production ceased in 1941 after 1,100 rifles had been made due to excessive strides in modern armor (tanks) thus making the 20mm round obsolete. Due to emergency war demands, production was ordered again, and 100 rifles were built by the Japanese Steel Works in 1943; for a total production figure of approximately 1,200 rifles. Sometimes referred to as an antitank machine (or automatic) cannon, it could be carried by two men in any terrain. The weapon had a semi-automatic action which gave it a high rate of fire. On the downside the recoil from the large round was very violent. The gun could be fitted with a protective shield pushing the total weight up to 68 kg (150 lb). The Ho-1 and Ho-3 automatic aircraft cannon were developed from the Type 97.  Armour penetration was 30 mm at 90° at 250 metres.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105211;New Infantry Gun Design: The Type 38 75mm Field Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105211;Although Japan had extensive experience with artillery, as the result of its war with Russia in 1904-05, and had the technology and industrial infrastructure to construct medium or large caliber naval weapons prior to World War I, planners at the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff turned to Krupp in Germany, for the latest trend in artillery design. Initial units were imported, and then eventually over 2000 units, which were designed "Type 38" in Japan, were produced under license by the Army’s Osaka Arsenal. The original Type 38 gun had a conical interrupted-thread breech, a single box type trail which limited gun elevation to only 16°30'. Also, there were no equilibrators as the trunnions were at the gun barrel's center of balance. All of these shortcomings were remedied with a redesign following World War I. After World War I, these weapons were considered largely obsolete. However, by this time, Japanese production capabilities had improved, and the Type 38 underwent a re-design in Japan to improve the carriage, with a corresponding increase in elevation, range and rate of fire to 10-12 rounds per minute.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105212;New Infantry Gun Design: The Type 90 75mm Field Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105212;The Type 90 75 mm Field Gun was a field gun used by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet-Japanese Border Wars and World War II. The Type 90 designation was given to this gun as it was accepted in the year 2590 of the Japanese calendar (1930). It was intended to replace the Type 38 75 mm Field Gun in front line combat units, but due to operational and budgetary constraints, the Type 38 continued to be used.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105213;New Howitzer Design: The Type 91 105mm Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105213;The Type 91 105mm howitzer was an orthodox design howitzer, based largely on contemporary French Canon de 105 mle 1913 Schneider howitzers ordered during the late 1920s by the Japanese Army Technical Bureau for evaluation purposes. It was intended to supplement, and eventually supersede the largely obsolete Type 38 15 cm howitzer, which had been in service since the end of the Russo-Japanese War. Over one thousand units were produced beginning in 1931.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105214;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The Type 94 37mm Anti-Tank Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105214;The Type 94 37mm AT gun was introduced in 1936. The design originated as an improvement to the Type 11 37 mm Infantry Gun, which was also used as a primitive anti-tank weapon. However, its short bore, low muzzle velocity, short range and slow reloading time gave it only a limited capacity against enemy armor. Development of a replacement began in July 1933 and was completed a year later. Initial testing indicated that a trained crew could fire up to 30 rounds per minute, however, Army planners felt that the initial design was too heavy. A modified design was tested in 1935, and actual production began in 1936, however, the weapon retained its original “Type 94” (imperial year 2594 = western year 1934) designation. Approximately 3,400 units were produced.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105215;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The Type 1 47mm Anti-Tank Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105215;The Type 1 47 mm Anti-Tank gun was accepted into service in 1942. The design originated as an improvement to the prototype “Experimental Type 97 (1937) 47 mm Anti-Tank Gun”, which was tested between 1938 and 1939. The prototype weighed 567 kilograms with a barrel length of 2,515 mm, a traverse range of ±50 degrees and an elevation range of between minus 10 and plus 20 degrees, and a muzzle velocity of 730 m/s. The prototype was not accepted into service because it was considered to not have sufficient performance. After the Nomonhan Incident, the Imperial Japanese Army started the development of a new anti-tank gun, considering that the Type 94 37 mm Anti-Tank Gun would likely be ineffective against the new Soviet tanks. The design was the first completely indigenous anti-tank gun design completed in Japan, and production was assigned to the Army's Osaka Arsenal. In terms of performance, the design was still somewhat inferior to advanced contemporary designs in western nations, but was considered suitable by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff due to the anticipated lack of armor by the National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China, and by the belief that Japan would face only light tanks fielded by the Allied nations in case of a more general war. The Type 1 47 mm AT Gun was introduced in 1942, and approximately 2,300 were produced.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105216;New Anti-Aircraft Gun Design: The Type 98 20mm Anti-Aircraft Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105216;The Type 98 20 mm AA machine cannon was the most common light anti-aircraft gun of the Imperial Japanese Army. The Type 98 designation was given to this gun as it was accepted in the year 2598 of the Japanese calendar (1938) About 80% of IJA light AA guns were Type 98s. It entered service in 1938 and first saw combat in Nomonhan. It was used until the end of World War II. After World War II this gun was used by the Indonesian Army in the Indonesian National Revolution. The gun can be emplaced in about three minutes by an experienced crew or fired inaccurately from its wheels. This weapon and its variants were based on the French design of the 13.2mm Hotchkiss machine gun of the 1930s, which the Japanese forces had bought and further developed at home.  It was also mounted on the back of a Type 94 6-Wheeled Truck to serve as a self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105217;New Anti-Aircraft Gun Design: The Type 96 25mm Anti-Aircraft Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105217;The Type 96 was the standard Japanese medium Anti-Aircraft weapon of the Imperial Japanese Navy, being mounted aboard practically everything that floated, and was also used in land bases in the Japanese Empire and in the Japanese overseas combat fronts. These weapons were also used as anti-tank guns in some defensive actions in Pacific theaters and against land objectives in southeast Asia/Chinese mainland during the Pacific War.  Historically over 20,000 of these guns were produced, but mostly used about naval vessels.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105218;New Heavy Mortar Design: The Type 98 320mm Heavy Mortar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105218;The 320mm Type 98 mortar, known by the nickname "Ghost rockets", was an artillery weapon used by the Japanese military during World War II, especially during the Battle of Iwo Jima.  Japanese officers believed the 320 mm spigot mortar's most effective method of employment was as a psychological weapon, intended to scare American soldiers more than inflict casualties. The 675-pound (306 kg) shells left craters 8 feet (2.4 m) deep and 15 feet (4.6 m) wide, but caused relatively few casualties due to minimal fragmentation. The mortars were mainly operated by the 20th Independent Mortar Battalion. During the Iwo Jima campaign, many of the 12 to 24 launchers were placed inside the mouths of caves to protect them from American artillery bombardment, requiring the gun crews to live in the caves that housed their guns, like the infantry.[5] Due to the relative difficulty involved in moving such a massive weapon system, their locations usually remained fixed during battles. During the campaign, the object of the gun crews seemed to be mainly to inflict psychological damage on the American troops instead of killing them.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105219;New Rocket Launcher Design: The Type 4 200mm Rocket Launcher;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105219;The Type 4 rocket mortar was developed in the final stages of World War II by the Japanese Army Technical Bureau, as a low-cost, easy to produce weapon, which had an advantage of greater accuracy over conventional mortars in that it fired spin-stabilized projectiles. The first units were deployed in 1943, and were used successfully in combat during the Battle of Iwo Jima and Battle of Okinawa. Due to its ease of construction and portability, the Type 4 was produced in large numbers and distributed to hidden arsenals for use as last-ditch weapons during the projected Allied invasion of the Japanese home islands.  Although the weapon came with a standard mortar tube with tripod mounting, if necessary, the rocket-propelled round could be launched from an ordinary pipe or culvert with sufficient diameter, wooden rails, or even directly from a slope in the ground.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105220;New Anti-Tank Rocket Design: The Type 4 70mm Anti-Tank Rocket;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105220;The Type 4 70 mm AT Rocket Launcher was a Japanese rocket launcher used during the last year of World War II. It was to be used in the Japanese mainland in case of an invasion by the Allies. It is comparable to the German Panzerschreck and the American Bazooka. By 1944 the Americans were using M1 Bazooka anti tank rocket launchers in the Pacific Theater against the Japanese. In response, the Japanese began development of the Type 4 Rocket Launcher. Unlike the US rocket that used fins to stabilize it in flight, the Japanese rocket had angled venturis in the base to spin the rocket for stability, similar to the 20 cm (8”) HE rocket.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105221;New Light Tank Design: The Type 92 Tankette;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105221;It all began with the need, after WW1, to mechanize the cavalry arm of the IJA, at first with armoured cars. But, for the Japanese Imperial Forces operating in Manchuria, the harsh climatic conditions and bad roads prevented any efficient use of these vehicles, and advocated the need for tanks. The cavalry corps, relatively independent from the army, wanted an affordable, fast and light scouting tank. In 1925-29, the Imperial Japanese Army Cavalry School based at Chiba tested several foreign tanks for its needs. The Carden-Lloyd tankettes quickly appeared as the best suited for this purpose, and the ones bought served as a basis for the first indigenous-built tankettes. The first developed vehicle was an amphibious tankette, later known as the Type 92 A-I-Go. But road and off-road performance proved so bad in trials, that this model was dropped in favour of a more conventional vehicle. The production was assured by Ishikawajima Motorcar Manufacturing Company (now Isuzu). As vehicles were intended for the cavalry corps, it could not be classified as a tank, so it was officially called a "heavy armoured car" (Kyu-ni-shiki Jyu-sokosha) instead, taking the number 92 in the imperial army ordnance register.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105222;New Infantry Tank Design: The Type 89 I-Go Infantry Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105222;The Type 89 medium tank I-Go was a medium tank used by the Imperial Japanese Army from 1932 to 1942 in combat operations of the Second Sino-Japanese War, at Khalkhin Gol against the Soviet Union, and in the Second World War. The Type 89B model was the world's first mass-produced diesel engine tank. The tank was armed with a short-barrel 57 mm cannon for knocking out pillboxes and masonry fortifications, and proved effective in campaigns in Manchuria and China, as the Chinese National Revolutionary Army had only three tank battalions to oppose them, which consisted primarily of Vickers export models, German Panzer Is, and Italian CV33 tankettes. The Type 89 was a 1920s design medium tank, built to support the infantry, and thus lacked the armor or armament of 1940s generation Allied armor and was regarded as obsolete by the time of the battles of Khalkhin Gol, against the Soviet Union, in 1939. The code designation "I-Go" comes from the katakana letter for “first” and the kanji for “number”. The designation is sometimes transliterated 'Yi-Go.';;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105223;New Light Tank Design: The Type 95 Ha-Go Light Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105223;The Type 95 Ha-Go was a light tank used by the Imperial Japanese Army in combat operations of the Second Sino-Japanese War, at Nomonhan against the Soviet Union, and in the Second World War. It proved sufficient against infantry, but, like the American M3 Stuart, it was not designed to fight other tanks. Approximately 2,300 units were produced, making it the most numerous Japanese armored fighting vehicle of the time.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105224;New Light Tank Design: The Type 97 Chi-Ha Light Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105224;The Type 97 Chi-Ha was a medium tank used by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Battles of Khalkhin Gol against the Soviet Union, and the Second World War. It was the most widely produced Japanese medium tank of World War II, although the armor protection was average for a 1930s tank. The 57 mm main gun, designed for infantry support, was a carry over from the 1933 Type 89 medium tank. Later it was replaced by a 47 mm gun that was more effective against armor. The 170hp Mitsubishi engine was a capable tank engine in 1938, and – notably for the time – it was an air cooled diesel. After 1941, the tank was less effective than most Allied tank designs. The Type 97's low silhouette and semicircular radio antenna on the turret distinguished the tank from its contemporaries. The crude suspension was derived from the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank, but used six road wheels instead of four.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105225;New Infantry Tank Design: The Type 97 Chi-Ha Shinhoto Infantry Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105225;The Type 97 Chi-Ha Shinhoto was a medium tank used by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Battles of Khalkhin Gol against the Soviet Union, and the Second World War. It was the most widely produced Japanese medium tank of World War II, although the armor protection was average for a 1930s tank. The 57 mm main gun, designed for infantry support, was a carry over from the 1933 Type 89 medium tank. Later it was replaced by a 47 mm gun that was more effective against armor. The 170 hp Mitsubishi engine was a capable tank engine in 1938, and – notably for the time – it was an air cooled diesel. After 1941, the tank was less effective than most Allied tank designs. The Type 97's low silhouette and semicircular radio antenna on the turret distinguished the tank from its contemporaries. The crude suspension was derived from the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank, but used six road wheels instead of four.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105226;New Medium Tank Design: The Type 1 Chi-He Medium Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105226;The Type 1 Chi-He was developed in 1942 to replace the Type 97. The newer tank proved to be superior to the Type 97 in both speed and armor protection, but due to the rapid pace of events, the Japanese Army had shown little interest in this new tank. The turret and 47mm gun of the Type 1 could be mounted on the hull of the Type 97 (creating the Shinhoto Chi-Ha version) and the factories were already mass-producing the older tank. Production of the Chi-He started in 1944, but was discontinued after less than one year in favor of the Type 3 Chi-Nu medium tank.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105227;New Medium Tank Design: The Type 3 Chi-Nu Medium Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105227;The Type 3 Chi-Nu medium tank was urgently developed to counter the American M4 Sherman medium tank. Originally, the next tank in development to replace the Chi-He was the Type 4 Chi-To medium tank. However, the development of the Chi-To and the Type 5 Chi-Ri heavy tank was delayed, again due to a steel shortage, and a stopgap tank was required. The development of Chi-Nu started in May 1944 and was completed in October of that year. The Chi-Nu retained the same chassis and suspension of the Type 97 but in a large new hexagonal gun turret. The main armament, a Type 3 75mm Tank Gun, was based on the Japanese Type 90 field gun. The Chi-Nu was the last tank deployed by the IJA, and production continued until the end of the war. The tank was allocated to the Japanese home islands to defend against the projected Allied Invasion.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105228;New Medium Tank Design: The Type 4 Chi-To Medium Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105228;The Type 4 medium tank Chi-To was one of several new medium and heavy tanks developed by the Imperial Japanese Army towards the end of World War II. It was the most advanced Japanese wartime tank to reach the production phase. The Type 4 Chi-To was a thirty-ton, all-welded tank with a maximum armor thickness of about 75mm. It was much larger than the Type 97 Chi-Ha, with a longer, wider, tall chassis, supported by seven road wheels. The main armament, a Type 5 75mm Tank Gun, was based on the Type 4 75 mm AA Gun, which was in turn essentially a copy of a Bofors Model 1929 75 mm AA Gun, housed in a large powered, well-armoured hexagonal gun turret along with a coaxial machine gun. A single Type 97 light machine gun was also mounted in the bow, but there was no machine gun mounted to the rear of the turret. Only two Type 4 Chi-To tanks were completed prior to the end of the war, with an additional four nearing completion. Historically, neither of the two completed units saw combat use.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105229;New Medium Tank Design: The Type 5 Chi-Ri Medium Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105229;The Type 5 medium tank Chi-Ri was the penultimate medium tank developed by the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II. Intended to be a heavier, lengthened, more powerful version of Japan's sophisticated Type 4 Chi-To medium tank, in performance it was designed to surpass the US M4 Sherman medium tanks being fielded by the Allied forces. It was to be powered by a "Kawasaki Type 98 800 HP engine Ha-9-IIb" detuned for the tank to 550 hp. Originally, the tank was to be fitted with the same Type 5 75 mm Tank Gun used on the Type 4 Chi-To. Eventually, an 88 mm gun (based on the Type 99 88 mm AA Gun) was planned for the turret; a secondary weapon of a front hull-mounted Type 1 37 mm Tank Gun was fitted in the position normally taken by a machine gun. As with many innovative weapons projects launched by Japan in the final days of World War II, production could not advance beyond the prototype stage due to material shortages, and the loss of Japan's industrial infrastructure to the allied bombing of Japan. The single prototype Type 5 was seized by American forces during the occupation of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105230;New Super Heavy Tank Design: The I-O Super Heavy Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105230;The O-I experimental super heavy tank had three turrets and weighed 120 tons, and required a crew of 11 men. It was 10 meters long by 4.2 meters wide with an overall height of 4 meters. The armor was 200mm at its maximum, and the tank had a top speed of 25km/h. This version had two gasoline engines, and was armed with 1 x 105 mm cannon, 1 x Type 1 37 mm (in a forward-mounted sub-turret), and 3 x Type 97 7.7 mm machine guns (one mounted in a forward sub-turret) while an ultra heavy version also mounted a Type 1 37 mm in a rear-facing sub-turret. It has been reported the one copy of the O-I was manufactured before the end of the war and was shipped to Manchuria, according to an engineer concerned with the project, however no images of the O-I have been found, only some drawings are known to exist.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105231;New Amphibious Tank Design: The Type 2 Ka-Mi Amphibious Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105231;As early as 1928, the Japanese Army had been developing and testing amphibious tanks and created several experimental models such as the SR-II, the Type 1 Mi-Sha and the Type 92 A-I-Go which either never made it off the drawing board or were produced only as one-off prototypes for concept testing. In 1940, The Navy took over development of amphibious vehicles and two years later came up with the Type 2 Ka-Mi. The Type 2 Ka-Mi was designed for the Navy's Special Naval Landing Forces for the amphibious invasion of Pacific Islands without adequate port facilities, and for various special operations missions. Only 184 units of the Type 2 Ka-Mi were built, beginning in 1942, due to the number of complex components and due to the fact that it had to be nearly completely hand-built.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105232;New Amphibious Tank Design: The Type 3 Ka-Chi Amphibious Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105232;The Type 3 Ka-Chi amphibious tank was first encountered by Allied forces at the Battle of Kwajalein in 1944, however, only 19 were built during the war. The Type 3 Ka-Chi was produced in very limited numbers, but proved useful due to its capacity to be submarine launched, which enabled it to accommodate the increasingly difficult task of daytime reinforcement isolated for island garrisons in the South Pacific and in Southeast Asia. The tanks were used later in the war as dug-in pillboxes on Pacific islands.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105233;New Amphibious Tank Design: The Type 5 To-Ku Amphibious Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105233;The To-Ku was large and heavy, it boasted extensive armor protection and a turret fitted with a 47mm Type 1 gun and 25mm Type 1 gun. Historically, only one model was built of this tank.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105234;New Assault Gun Design: The Type 1 Ho-Ni I Assault Gun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105234;The Type 1 Gun tank Ho-Ni I was a tank destroyer developed by the Imperial Japanese Army for use during World War II in the Pacific theater. As units of the Imperial Japanese Army began to encounter advanced Allied medium tanks, such as the M4 Sherman, it was seen that the Japanese Type 97 Chi-Ha main battle tank lacked sufficient armor or armament to deal with this threat, and work was begun on a tank destroyer version. The Type 1 Ho-Ni I was developed by utilizing the existing Type 97 chassis and engine, and replacing the gun turret with a 75 mm Type 90 Field Gun mounted in an open casemate with frontal and side armour only, which made it very vulnerable in close combat. The Type 1 Ho-Ni I was designed to operate as self-propelled artillery in the armored divisions. The mounting for the 75 mm Type 90 field gun allowed for ten degrees of traverse and elevation from -5 to +25 degrees. The Type 1 Ho-Ni I carried 54 rounds of ammunition.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105235;New Infantry Tank Design: The Type 2 Gun Tank Ho-I Infantry Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105235;The Type 2 Gun tank Ho-I Support Tank was a derivative of the Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tanks of the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II. Similar in concept to early variant of the German Panzer IV, it was designed as a self-propelled howitzer to provide the close-in fire support for standard Japanese medium tanks with additional firepower against enemy anti-tank fortifications. After experience in Manchukuo in the war in China, Japanese began work on mounting a Type 41 75 mm Mountain Gun onto the chassis of the Chi-Ha medium tank. The adapted mountain gun, known as the Type 99 7.5 cm Tank Gun, was completed in 1940.The main armaments of the Type 2 Ho-I was a Type 99 75 mm tank gun, and secondary armament was a single 7.7 mm Type 97 Light Machine Gun in the hull. The short barreled 75 mm Type 99 Gun was mounted in a fully rotating two-man gun turret.The Type 2 Ho-I utilized the chassis of the Type 1 Chi-He, which was itself a modified Type 97 Chi-Ha. By 1942, with the start of World War II, the Japanese army began to encounter the Allied M4 Sherman and M3 Stuart tanks, which they could barely cope with. The design parameters on the Type 2 were then changed to include a tank destroyer role, with its 75 mm gun equipped with armor-piercing shells.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105236;New Tank Destroyer Design: The Type 3 Gun Tank Ho-Ni III Tank Destroyer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105236;The Type 3 Ho-Ni III gun tank was a tank destroyer and self-propelled artillery of Imperial Japanese Army in World War II. The Type 3 No-Ni II superseded the Type 1 Ho-Ni I in production, and was much safer for the crew due to its having a completely enclosed superstructure. The Type 3 Ho-Ni III utilized the chassis of the earlier Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank. The main armament of the Type 3 Ho-Ni III was a 75 mm Type 90 Field Gun, loosely based on the French Schneider et Cie Canon de 85 mle 1927 which was also used in the Type 3 Chi-Nu tank. Previous gun tanks, Type 1 Ho-Ni I and Type 2 Ho-I, were not really optimized designs. The fully enclosed and armored casemate of the Type 3 Ho-Ni III was intended to address the issues, and an order was placed with Hitachi Ltd in early 1944. Production was hampered by material shortages, and by the bombing of Japan in World War II, and only 31 or 41 units were completed by the time of the end of the war. Although the Type 3 Ho-Ni III were assigned to various combat units, most were stationed within the Japanese home islands to defend against the projected Allied Invasion. As the surrender of Japan occurred before that invasion, historically there is no record of the Type 3 Ho-Ni III ever being used in actual combat.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105237;New Tank Destroyer Design: The Type 5 Na-To Tank Destroyer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105237;The Type 5 Na-To was the penultimate tank destroyer developed by the Imperial Japanese Army in the closing stages of World War II. The Type 5 Na-To made use of the chassis of the Type 4 Chi-So medium tracked carrier. Its main anti-tank armament consisted of a Type 5 75 mm Tank Gun which was the same gun that was used on the Type 4 Chi-To tank; a variant of the Japanese Type 4 75mm AA Gun. Near the end of the Pacific War, Japanese field commanders realized that nothing in the inventory of the Japanese army would be able to withstand the increasingly advanced tanks and armored vehicles fielded by the Allies, and that a more powerful version of the Type 3 Ho-Ni III was necessary. Development was rushed through on a new design, which was completed in 1945. The Japanese army immediately issued an order for 200 units to be completed in 1945. However, by that time production was impossible due to material shortages, and by the bombing of Japan in World War II, and testing was not yet completed by the end of the war. Only two units were completed by the surrender of Japan. Historically, neither was used in combat.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105238;New Main Battle Tank Design: The Type 61 Main Battle Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105238;The Type 61 was a main battle tank (MBT) developed and used historically by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Development started in 1955 and the vehicle was first deployed in April 1961. The type number follows the year of deployment. A total of 560 Type 61's were manufactured between 1961 to 1975, when production ceased. The Type 61 is conventionally laid out, with a central turret and the engine located at the rear of the hull. The tank has a crew of four, a commander, driver, gunner and loader. The hull is welded steel, with a cast steel turret. The maximum armour thickness is quoted as 64 millimeters. A 12.7 mm machine gun was normally mounted on the cuppola for anti-aircraft use. The main gun was the Type 61 90 millimeter caliber rifled gun with a horizontal sliding breach block. The gun is fitted with a t-shaped muzzle brake, which diverts firing gasses sideways, and reduces the amount of dust kicked up by firing. A coaxial 7.62 millimeter machine gun is mounted next to the gun.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9105239;New Submachinegun Design: The Type 100 Submachinegun;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9105239;Designed and built by the Nambu Arms Manufacturing Company under a low-priority military contract, the Type 100 was a submachinegun that was first delivered to the Imperial Army in 1942. Japan was surprisingly late to introduce the sub-machine gun to its armed forces — a few models of the SIG Bergmann 1920 (a licensed version of the German MP 18) were purchased from Switzerland in the 1920s. These were examined and copied, with significant changes. In 1942 the Type 100 SMG was first delivered for service, used by Japanese marines during the invasion of Southern China.;;;;;;;;;;x
