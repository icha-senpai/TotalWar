EVTNAME9106100;New Bolt Action Rifle Design: The Mauser Gewehr 98;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106100;The Gewehr 98 (abbreviated G98, Gew 98 or M98) is a German bolt action Mauser rifle firing cartridges from a 5 round internal clip-loaded magazine that was the German service rifle from 1898 to 1935, when it was replaced by the Karabiner 98k. The Gewehr 98 action, using stripper clip loading with the powerful 7.92x57mm Mauser cartridge, introduced advanced infantry weapon features rapidly adopted in the Anglo-American Pattern 1914 Enfield/M1917 Enfield and the Japanese Arisaka Type 38/Type 99. The Gewehr 98 replaced the earlier Gewehr 1888 rifle as the German service rifle, first saw combat in the Boxer Rebellion, and was the main German infantry rifle of World War I. The Gewehr 98 saw further military use by the Ottoman Empire and by Spanish Nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106101;New Bolt Action Rifle Design: The Mauser Karabiner Kar 98k;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106101;The Karabiner 98 Kurz (often abbreviated Kar98k, K98, or K98k) is a bolt action rifle chambered for the 7.92x57mm Mauser cartridge that was adopted on 21 June 1935 as the standard service rifle by the German Wehrmacht. It was one of the final developments in the long line of Mauser military rifles. Although supplemented by semi- and fully automatic rifles during World War II, it remained the primary German service rifle until the end of the war in 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106102;New Bolt Action Rifle Design: The Volkssturmgewehr VG;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106102;The Volkssturmgewehr ("People's Assault Rifle") is the name of several rifle designs developed by Nazi Germany during the last months of World War II. They share the common characteristic of being greatly simplified as an attempt to cope with severe lack of resources and industrial capacities in Germany during the final period of the war.  The weapon's name is an ambivalent portmanteau: in German Gewehr means "rifle", whereas Sturmgewehr means "assault rifle". The term "Volkssturmgewehr" can therefore be translated either as "People's Assault Rifle" or "Volkssturm Rifle".;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106103;New Semi-Automatic Rifle Design: The Gewehr 41;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106103;When the Heereswaffenamt (German ordnance department) requested designs for what would become the G41, both Mauser and Walther submitted samples. The Walther version was ultimately accepted, but intially several thousand of both types were ordered for testing and evaluation. The G41(W) was a complicated affair, but the G41(M) was even worse.  Both designs for the G41 used virtually identical nose caps and gas pistons of the Bang type (the two companies probably collaborated on that element of the design). The mechanical similarities end there, though. The G41(M) connecting rod pushes against a block under the barrel and in front of the receiver, which in turn is connected to an addition pair of bars (one on each side of the receiver) that push on the bolt carrier. This was done to comply with the HWaA requirement that there be no moving parts on the top of the rifle (Walther ignored this requirement). The bolt on the G41(M) was of a rotating type, with two locking lugs on the front and a spiral cam rail machined into its exterior (similar to a Ross or Schmidt-Rubin rifle). This cam interacted with a matching groove cut in the bolt carrier, so when the bolt carrier was pushed backwards upon firing, it would rotate and unlock the bolt and then pull it rearwards. This operating system required no fewer than eight different moving parts (plus springs) just for cycling. For comparison, the AK uses two. For another measure of complexity, the G41(M) has eighteen different springs.  The G41(M) was manufactured in 1941 and 1942 (mostly 1942), and assembly of rifles continued until March of 1943 (or possibly a little later).  Production was slow because the company was heavily involved in building K98k rifles. In the field, the G41(M) proved unpopular with troops. In addition to being exceedingly complex and susceptible to fouling and malfunction, it was a long, heavy (11.5 pounds), and poorly balanced rifle. Captured SVT-40 Tokarev rifles were much preferred, and most of the G41(M)s ended up in the hands of second-line soldiers. The vast majority were lost or destroyed in Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106104;New Semi-Automatic Rifle Design: The Gewehr 43;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106104;In 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union as part of Operation Barbarossa. Just prior to the opening of hostilities the Soviet Red Army had started re-arming its infantry, complementing its older bolt-action rifles with the new semi-automatic SVT-38s and SVT-40s. This proved to be somewhat of a shock to the Germans, who ramped up their semi-automatic rifle development efforts significantly.  The SVT series used a simple gas-operated mechanism, which was soon emulated by Walther in the G41(W), producing the Gewehr 43 (or G43). The simpler, sturdier design and mechanism of the G43 made it lighter, easier to produce, more reliable and also much tougher than the Gewehr 41, elite German mountain troops would use them as ladder rungs during climbing. The addition of a 10-round detachable box magazine was an improvement over the fixed box magazine of the G41(W). The Gewehr 43 was intended, like the G41, to be loaded using 5-round stripper clips without removing the magazine. The Gewehr 43 was put into production in October 1943, and followed in 1944 by the Karabiner 43 (K43), which was identical to the G43 in every way except for the letter stamped on the side. The name change from Gewehr to Karabiner (carbine) was due to the fact the rifle was actually two centimetres longer than the standard Karabiner 98k and therefore the term Gewehr (meaning: long rifle) was somewhat unfitting. The Wehrmacht intended to equip each grenadier (infantry) company in the army with 19 G43s, including 10 with scopes, for issue as the company commander saw fit. This issue was never completely achieved. The total production by the end of the war is estimated to have been 402,713 of both models.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106105;New Submachine Gun Design: The MP 18;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106105;The MP 18.1 manufactured by Theodor Bergmann Abteilung Waffenbau was the first practical submachine gun used in combat. It was introduced into service in 1918 by the German Army during World War I as the primary weapon of the Sturmtruppen, assault groups specialized in trench combat. Although MP18 production ended in the 1920s, its design formed the basis of most submachine guns manufactured between 1920 and 1960.  The firepower of this new class of weapons made such an impression on the Allies that the Treaty of Versailles specifically banned further study and manufacture of such light automatic firearms by Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106106;New Submachine Gun Design: The MP 35;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106106;The MP35 (Maschinenpistole 35, literally "Machine Pistol 35") was a submachine gun (SMG) used by the Wehrmacht, Waffen-SS and German police both before and during World War II. It was developed in the early 1930s by Emil Bergmann (son of Theodor Bergmann) and manufactured at the Bergmann company in Suhl (that also built the one of the first submachine guns, the MP 18).;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106107;New Submachine Gun Design: The MP 38;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106107;The MP38 may be considered as one of the last sub-machineguns that was almost completely build with machined parts. It's a beautifully made gun and superiour in quality and finish to the MP40. The MP38 consist out of 3 main parts. These are the barrel and receiver section (1), the grip (2) and the telescope spring with the bolt (3). To look at every part in detail please check the . The receiver section is, contrary to the mp40, completely made of machined steel. In order to lighten the receiver the tube was provided with longitudinal grooves over the full length. Also the magazine receiver had a hole to lighten up the weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106108;New Submachine Gun Design: The MP 40;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106108;The Maschinenpistole 40 ("Machine pistol 40") descended from its predecessor the MP 38, which was in turn based on the MP 35, a prototype made of machined steel. The MP 35 was developed independently by Erma Werke's Berthold Geipel with funding from the German Army. It took design elements from Heinrich Vollmer's VPM 1930 and EMP. Vollmer then worked on Berthold Geipel's MP 36 and in 1938 submitted a prototype to answer a request from the Heereswaffenamt (Army Weapons Office) for a new submachine gun, which was adopted as MP 38. The MP 38 was a simplification of the MP 35, and the MP 40 was a further simplification of the MP 38, with certain cost-saving alterations, most notably in the more extensive use of stamped steel rather than machined parts.  The MP 40 was often called the "Schmeisser" by the Allies, after the weapon designer Hugo Schmeisser. Schmeisser had designed the MP 18, which was the first mass-produced submachine gun in the world, and carried some resemblance to the MP 40. He did not, however, have anything to do with the design or development of the MP 40, although he held a patent on the magazine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106109;New Submachine Gun Design: The MP 41;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106109;The MP-41 (M.P. 41) submachine gun was developed by Hugo Schmeisser, son of the Louis Schmeisser who developed the first practical machine gun, the MP-18.At the time of development of MP-41, that is, in 1941, the company C.G.Haenel,at which Schmeisser was chief designer, manufactured MP-40 submachine guns for German army. It is possible that Schmeisser decided to develop a submachine gun which was better suited for infantry use than the MP-40.For this reason, he combined the receiver, action and magazine of MP-40 with the wooden stock and selective-fire mechanism of MP-28.  Haenel company produced more than few MP-41 submachine guns, which were mostly purchased by SS troops, which had their own supply chains. However, late in 1941 Erma company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Haenel, and as a result, Haenel company was forced to close the production of MP-41. Only 26,700 guns of MP-41 pattern were made during the war, and most were issued to SS, SDand police troops.  The MP-41 (M.P. 41) submachine gun is blowback operated, selective-fire weapon which fires from open bolt. It uses bolt with telescoped return spring guide, borrowed from MP-40 along with receiver and magazine. The wooden stock and trigger unit with cross-bolt button fire mode selector were taken from MP-28.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106110;New Assault Rifle Design: The StG 44;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106110;The StG 44 (abbreviation of Sturmgewehr 44, "assault rifle 44") is a German selective-fire rifle developed during World War II that was the first of its kind to see major deployment and is considered to be the first modern assault rifle. It is also known under the designations MP 43 and MP 44 (Maschinenpistole 43, Maschinenpistole 44 respectively). The StG 44 was the first successful weapon of its class, and the concept had a major impact on modern infantry small arms development. By all accounts, the StG 44 fulfilled its role admirably, particularly on the Eastern Front, offering a greatly increased volume of fire compared to standard infantry rifles and greater range than submachine guns.  The rifle was chambered for the 7.92×33mm Kurz[9][10] cartridge. This shorter version of the German standard (7.92x57mm) rifle round, in combination with the weapon's selective-fire design, provided a compromise between the controllable firepower of a submachine gun at close quarters with the accuracy and power of a Karabiner 98k bolt-action rifle at intermediate ranges. While the StG44 had less range and power than the more powerful infantry rifles of the day, Army studies had shown that few combat engagements occurred at more than 300m and the majority within 200m. Full-power rifle cartridges were excessive for the vast majority of uses for the average soldier. Only a trained specialist, such as a sniper, or soldiers equipped with machine guns which fired multiple rounds at a known or suspected target could make full use of the standard rifle round's range and power.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106111;New Assault Rifle Design: The StG 45;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106111;The StG 45(M) was intended to replace the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle, because the latter was rather expensive and time-consuming to produce. Compared to the StG44's cost of 70 Reichsmarks, the StG45(M)'s calculated cost was 45 Reichsmarks. Parts for only 30 complete rifles were produced before the war ended.  While the StG45(M) was intended to use the same 30-round magazine as its predecessor, the rifle is commonly pictured with the 10-round magazine designed for the Volkssturmgewehr. The shorter magazine was used by Mauser engineers during testing, as its lower profile was easier to use when test-firing at the Mauser facility range.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106112;New Light Machine Gun Design: The MG 15;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106112;The MG 15 was a German 7.92 mm machine gun designed specifically as a hand manipulated defensive gun for combat aircraft during the early 1930s. By 1941 it was replaced by other types and found new uses with ground troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106113;New General Purpose Machine Gun Design: The MG 34;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106113;The Maschinengewehr 34, or MG 34, is a German recoil-operated air-cooled machine gun, first tested in 1929, introduced in 1934, and issued to units in 1936. It accepts the 7.92x57mm Mauser cartridge, and is generally considered the world's first general-purpose machine gun. The versatile MG 34 was arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time of its deployment. Its combination of exceptional mobility – being light enough to be carried by one man – and high rate of fire (of up to 900 rounds per minute) was unmatched. It entered service in great numbers following Hitler's repudiation of the Versailles Treaty in 1936, and was first tested by German troops aiding Franco's Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106114;New General Purpose Machine Gun Design: The MG 42;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106114;The MG 42 (shortened from German: Maschinengewehr 42, or "machine gun 42") is a 7.92x57mm Mauser general purpose machine gun designed in Nazi Germany and used extensively by the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS during the second half of World War II. Intended to replace the more expensive and time-consuming to manufacture frontline MG 34, they ended up produced in tandem until the end of the war.  The MG 42 has a proven record of reliability, durability, simplicity, and ease of operation, but is most notable for its ability to produce a high volume of suppressive fire. The MG 42 had one of the highest average cyclic rate of any single-barreled man-portable machine gun: between 1,200 and 1,500 rpm, which results in a distinctive muzzle report.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106115;New Mortar Design: The Granatwerfer 34 81mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106115;The 8mm Granatwerfer 34 (8mm GrW 34) was the standard German heavy mortar throughout World War II. It gained a reputation for extreme accuracy and rapid rate of fire, although much of the credit should go to the training of the crews.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106116;New Mortar Design: The Granatwerfer 36 50mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106116;The mortar's development was started in 1934 by Rheinmetall-Borsig AG and it was adopted for service in 1936. Its intended role was to engage pockets of resistance that were beyond a hand grenade's throwing range. Until 1938, it used a complicated telescopic sight. By 1941, the Granatwerfer 36 was seen as too complex for its intended role. It fired too light a shell and had too short of a range. It was used as a platoon mortar and operated by a 3-man team. Production was terminated in 1941. By 1942, it had been gradually withdrawn from front line service. However, it remained in use with second-line and garrison units until the end of the Second World War in 1945. As ammunition stocks for the mortar dwindled during 1944-1945, coupled with the loss of the actual mortars, the Germans often relied on captured French and Soviet 50 mm mortars. The 50 mm continued to be popular for the remainder of the war, simply because it was easily transported by two men, and provided the Infantry with a hitting power and range capability greater than any other weapon readily available at the squad or section level.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106117;New Mortar Design: The Granatwerfer 42 120mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106117;The 120mm Granatwerfer 42 (literally, "grenade thrower Model 42") was a mortar used by Germany during World War II.  Developed in 1942, the 120mm (about 4.7 in) GrW 42 was an attempt to give German infantry units a close support weapon with a heavier performance than the mortars used in general service at the time. This weapon was very similar to the mortar used by Soviet forces on the Eastern Front which in turn was an improved version of the French 120 mm Brandt m35 mortar. The 120 mm Brandt m35 was used in limited quantities during the battle of France and exported to the USSR and other nations before the country's capitulation in 1940. The Soviet PM 38 120mm mortar, were captured in large quantities during the war in the East and pressed into service by the Germans and other Axis nations before the introduction of similar nationally produced 120mm mortar designs. The captured Soviet mortar was given the following designation in German use; 12 cm Granatwerfer 378(r). The GrW 42 was basically the usual three part construction made up of a circular base plate like the previous Soviet design, the tube itself and the supporting bipod. Because of the greater weight of the weapon (280 kilograms or 620 pounds) a two wheeled axle was utilised, enabling the mortar to be towed into action. The axle could then be quickly removed before firing.  The maximum range of the GrW 42, firing a 15.6 kg projectile, was approximately 6,050 m with an elevation of between 45 and 85 degrees. It has a maximum traverse of 16 degrees.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106118;New Anti-Tank Rifle Design: The Panzerbuchse 39;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106118;German anti-tank rifles originated back in 1917 with the Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr, the world's first anti-tank rifle. It was created in response to the appearance of the first British tanks on the Western Front. That single shot manually operated rifle enjoyed moderate success; approximately 15,800 rifles were built.  German development resumed in the late 1930s. In an effort to provide infantry with a man-portable lightweight anti-tank rifle, B. Brauer at Gustloff Werke in Suhl designed the Panzerbüchse 38 (PzB 38). It was a manually loaded single-shot weapon with a recoiling barrel. When fired, the barrel recoiled about 9 cm (3.5 in), which opened the breech and ejected the spent cartridge casing. The breech block was then arrested in the rear position, remaining opened for the gunner to manually insert a new cartridge. The gunner then released the cocked breech with a lever at the grip. The breech and barrel would then move forward again and the trigger was cocked in preparation to fire. This rather complicated mechanism was reportedly prone to jamming as the system got dirty in field use.  Although manufactured with pressed steel parts that were spot-welded, because of the complicated vertical breech block mechanism it was difficult to manufacture and only a small number of 1,408 PzB 38 rifles were built in 1939 and 1940 at the Gustloff Werke plant. 62 of these weapons were used by German troops in the invasion of Poland in 1939.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106119;New Anti-Tank Rifle Design: The Panzerbuchse 41;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106119;Although the sPzB 41 was classified as a heavy anti-tank rifle, its construction was much more typical of an anti-tank gun. Like the latter, it had a recoil mechanism, carriage and shield. The only significant feature the weapon had in common with anti-tank rifles was a lack of elevation and traverse mechanisms—the light barrel could be easily manipulated manually.  The design was based on a tapering barrel, with the caliber reducing from 28 mm at the chamber end to only 20mm at the muzzle. The projectile carried two external flanges; as it proceeded toward the muzzle, the flanges were squeezed down, decreasing the diameter with the result that pressure did not drop off as quickly and the projectile was propelled to a higher velocity. The barrel construction resulted in a very high muzzle velocity - up to 1,400 m/s. The bore was fitted with a muzzle brake. The horizontal sliding breech block was "quarter-automatic": it closed automatically once a shell was loaded. The gun was equipped with an open sight for distances up to 500m, a telescopic sight, (ZF 1х11 from the 3.7 cm Pak 36 anti-tank gun), could also be fitted.  The recoil system consisted of a hydraulic recoil buffer and spring-driven recuperator. The carriage was of the split trail type, with suspension. Wheels with rubber tires could be removed, making the gun significantly lower and therefore easier to conceal, the process took 30–40 seconds. The guns' construction allowed toolless dismantling to five pieces, the heaviest of which weighed 62 kg.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106120;New Anti-Tank Rocket Design: The Panzerfaust 60;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106120;The Panzerfaust (lit. "armor fist" or "tank fist", plural: Panzerfauste) was a cheap, single shot, recoilless German anti-tank weapon of World War II. It consisted of a small, disposable preloaded launch tube firing a high-explosive anti-tank warhead, and was operated by a single soldier. A similar but smaller weapon was named the Faustpatrone. The first generation Panzerfaust was in service from 1943 until the end of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106121;New Anti-Tank Rocket Design: The Panzerschreck;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106121;Panzerschreck (lit. "tank fright", "tank's fright" or "tank's bane") was the popular name for the Raketenpanzerbüchse (abbreviated to RPzB), an 88 mm calibre reusable anti-tank rocket launcher developed by Nazi Germany in World War II. Another popular nickname was Ofenrohr ("stove pipe").  The Panzerschreck was designed as a lightweight infantry anti-tank weapon. The weapon was shoulder-launched and fired a fin-stabilized rocket with a shaped-charge warhead. It was made in smaller numbers than the Panzerfaust, which was a disposable recoilless rifle firing an anti-tank warhead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106122;New Assault Rifle Design: The FG 42;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106122;The FG 42 (German: Fallschirmjagergewehr 42, "paratrooper rifle 42") is a selective-fire battle rifle produced in Nazi Germany during World War II. The weapon was developed specifically for the use of the Fallschirmjäger airborne infantry in 1942 and was used in very limited numbers until the end of the war.  It combined the characteristics and firepower of a light machine gun in a lightweight form no larger than the standard-issue Kar 98k bolt-action rifle. Considered one of the most advanced weapon designs of World War II, the FG 42 influenced post-war small arms development, and most of its design was copied by the US Army when they developed the M60 machine gun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106123;New Infantry Gun Design: The leFH 18 75mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106123;Development of the gun began in 1927, by Rheinmetall. The crew was protected by an armoured shield. There was a mountain gun variant, the 7.5 cm le.GebIG 18. For transport, the mountain variant could be broken down into six to ten packs, the heaviest weighing 74.9 kg. The Germans would typically assign two of these to each mountain battalion. Six 7.5 cm le.IG 18F were manufactured in 1939. These were airborne guns, capable of being broken down into four 140 kg loads. The airborne variant had smaller wheels and no shield. There was also an infantry support gun, known as the 7.5 cm Infanteriegeschütz L/13, which was designed as a replacement for the le.IG 18, this gun could be broken into four to six loads. However, though prototypes were tested, the German army felt that it did not improve on the existing design sufficiently to merit introduction and the army stayed with the earlier gun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106124;New Infantry Gun Design: The leFH 18 105mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106124;The 105mm leFH 18 (German: leichte FeldHaubitze "light field howitzer") was a German light howitzer used in World War II.  It had a heavy, simple breech mechanism with a hydro-pneumatic recoil system. The 10.5 cm leFH 18 had wood-spoked or pressed steel wheels. The former were only suitable for horse traction. Initially, it was not fitted with a muzzle brake. In 1941 a muzzle brake was fitted to allow longer range charges to be fired. This increased the range by about 1,800 yards and was known as the leFH 18M. In March 1942 a requirement was issued for a lighter howitzer. This led to a second modification, known as the leFH 18/40. This modification consisted of mounting the barrel of an leFH 18M on the carriage for a 7.5 cm PaK 40 antitank gun. The new carriage increased the rate of fire as well as making the howitzer lighter. Additionally, a more efficient muzzle brake was added, decreasing the recoil. Ballistically, the 10.5 cm leFH 18M and the leFH 18/40 are identical.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106125;New Light Howitzer Design: The leFH 18/40 105mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106125;In March 1942 a requirement was issued for a lighter howitzer by the Wehrmacht that must also be ready as soon as possible and capable of rapid production. This requirement was met by mounting the barrel of the leFH 18M on the carriage for a 7.5 cm PaK 40 antitank gun. The new carriage used torsion bars running the full length of the carriage to suspend the wheels. The original wheels of the PaK 40 mounting were too small for use by the howitzer and were replaced by larger pressed-steel wheels with solid rubber tires. The new mounting increased the rate of fire as well as making the howitzer somewhat lighter. The leFH 18/40 shared the different muzzle brakes used by the leFH 18M.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106126;New Howitzer Design: The sFH 18 150mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106126;The 15 cm schwere Feldhaubitze 18 or sFH 18 (German: "heavy field howitzer, model 18"), nicknamed Immergrün ("Evergreen"), was the basic German division-level heavy howitzer during the Second World War, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10.5 cm leFH 18. It was based on the earlier, First World War-era design of the 15 cm sFH 13, and while improved over that weapon, it was generally outdated compared to the weapons it faced. It was, however, the first artillery weapon equipped with rocket-assisted ammunition to increase range. The sFH 18 was also used in the self-propelled artillery piece schwere Panzerhaubitze 18/1 (more commonly known as Hummel).  The sFH 18 was one of Germany's three main 15 cm calibre weapons, the others being the 15 cm Kanone 18, a corps-level heavy gun, and the 15 cm sIG 33, a short-barreled infantry gun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106127;New Heavy Artillery Gun Design: The Kanone 16 150mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106127;The 15 cm Kanone 16 (15 cm K 16) was a heavy field gun used by Germany in World War I and World War II. Guns turned over to Belgium as reparations after World War I were taken into Wehrmacht service after the conquest of the Belgium as the 15 cm K 429(b). It generally served on coast-defense duties during World War II.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106128;New Heavy Artillery Gun Design: The Kanone 18 150mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106128;In 1933 Rheinmetall began development of a new artillery piece to fulfil a German Army requirement for a replacement of the aged 15 cm Kanone 16, with the first production units received in 1938. There was not much of an improvement over the older gun as it weighed two tons more than the K 16, but only had 2,290 metres (2,500 yd) more range. The army was happy with the range, but not with the carriage. There was a special transport carriage for just the gun when traveling long distances. Putting it on its turntable took even more time to assemble.  Around a hundred were built between 1939 and 1943. It was not popular in service as it was regarded as too much gun for too little shell. This caused its production to be terminated in August 1943. Many were used in coastal installations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106129;New Heavy Artillery Gun Design: The Kanone 39 150mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106129;Designed by Krupp as a dual-purpose heavy field and coast defence gun in the late-1930s for Turkey. Only two had been delivered before the rest were appropriated by the Heer upon the outbreak of World War II. In the coast defense role it was provided with an elaborate portable turntable. This had a central platform and twelve radial struts that connected to an outer ring. In action the trails would be locked together and put on a small trolley that rode on the outer ring. Coarse aiming was by cranking the trolley back and forth while fine laying was done by traversing the gun on its mount, up to the 6° limit imposed by the closed trails.  For transport it broke down into two loads, the barrel being removed and carried on its own wagon. A third wagon was necessary to carry the firing platform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106130;New Heavy Artillery Gun Design: The Kanone 18 170mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106130;In 1939 the 21 cm Morser 18 began appearing in the German Army Corps level Artillery Regiments, replacing the obsolescent World War I-era 21 cm Mörser 16. The gun was able to send a 113 kg (249 lb) HE shell out to a range of 14.5 km (15,857 yds), however by 1941 the German Army was seeking a longer range weapon and Krupp responded by producing a smaller 173 mm caliber increased velocity weapon utilising the same carriage, which became the Kanone 18.  The Kanone 18 quickly impressed German Artillery officers, firing a 68 kg (149 lb) HE shell out to a range of 29.6 km (18.4 mi), the real surprise was the explosive power of the shell, which was little different from the 113 kg shell of the 21 cm Mörser 18. Production commenced in 1941, in 1942 production of the 21 cm Mörser 18 was halted for almost two years so as to allow maximum production of the Kanone 18.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106131;New Rocket Artillery Design: The Nebelwerfer 41 150mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106131;The 150mm Nebelwerfer 41 (15 cm NbW 41) was a German multiple rocket launcher used in the Second World War. It served with units of the Nebeltruppen, the German equivalent of the U.S. Army's Chemical Corps. Just as the Chemical Corps had responsibility for poison gas and smoke weapons that were used instead to deliver high-explosives during the war, so did the Nebeltruppen. The name Nebelwerfer is best translated as "smoke thrower".;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9106132;The 210mm Nebelwerfer 42 (21 cm NbW 42) was a German multiple rocket launcher used in the Second World War. It served with units of the Nebeltruppen, the German equivalent of the American Chemical Corps. Just as the Chemical Corps had responsibility for poison gas and smoke weapons that were used instead to deliver high-explosives during the war so did the Nebeltruppen. The name "Nebelwerfer" is best translated as "smoke-thrower". It saw service from 1942–45 in all theaters except Norway.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106133;New SP Rocket Artillery Design: The Panzerwerfer 42 150mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106133;The German Panzerwerfer is one of two different types of half-tracked multiple rocket launchers employed by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. The two self-propelled artillery vehicles are the 150mm Panzerwerfer 42 auf Selbstfahrlafette Sd.Kfz.4/1 (based on the Opel Maultier, or "mule", half-track) and 150mm Panzerwerfer 42 auf Schwerer Wehrmachtsschlepper.  The Panzerwerfer 42 auf Maultier, Sd.Kfz. 4/1, first went into production in April 1943, and was produced until March 1945. Hitler called for production of the vehicle in January 1942, and the vehicle saw it's first tests on the Eastern Front in fall of 1943. Opel was the main manufacturer, producing most of the components, including the 3.6 liter, 6 cylinder Adam Opel engine, which had 68 horsepower and an 80 liter fuel capacity. Throughout the three years it was produced, 300 Panzerwerfers and 289 of it's variant, the Munitionskraftwagen, were made.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106134;New SP Rocket Artillery Design: The Wurfrahmen 40 'Walking Stuka';;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106134;The Wurfrahmen 40 ("launch frame 40") was a German World War II multiple rocket launcher. It combined a vehicle such as the SdKfz 251 halftrack or captured ex-French Renault UE Chenillette with rocket artillery to form a more mobile and protected artillery piece than the towed Nebelwerfer. It was nicknamed Stuka zu Fuss ("Stuka on Foot" or "Walking Stuka") and Heulende Kuh ("Bellowing Cow").  Introduced in late 1940, the weapon system was a framework with adjustable base plates fitted over and alongside a vehicle which could hold 300 mm high explosive (HE) rockets, 280 mm HE and 320 mm incendiary rockets were also used, the rockets being fired while in their loading crates. Although spin stabilized, the rockets were not as accurate as conventional artillery and reloading was time consuming due to the rocket's weight. Rockets were ripple-fired in large numbers where feasible to quickly saturate a target. The Wurfrahmen 40 was successful in service as a support weapon for the mobile Panzer formations, particularly in urban areas.  When used on the common mounting, the Sd.Kfz. 251 halftrack, a frame with six base plates were used, with three on each side. The Chenillette UE employed either two per side or four frames on the rear. The Hotchkiss H35 mounting used two per side also. Some captured American M3 halftracks also mounted Wurfrahmen, with four frames at two per side.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106135;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The Pak 36 37mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106135;The Pak 36 (Panzerabwehrkanone 36) was a German anti-tank gun that fired a 3.7 cm calibre shell. It was the main anti-tank weapon of Wehrmacht infantry units until mid-1941. It was followed in this role by the 5 cm Pak 38 gun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106136;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The Pak 38 50mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106136;The 5 cm Pak 38 (L/60) (5 cm Panzerabwehrkanone 38 (L/60)) was a German anti-tank gun of 50 mm calibre. It was developed in 1938 by Rheinmetall-Borsig AG as a successor to the 37 mm Pak 36, and was in turn followed by the 75 mm Pak 40.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106137;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The Pak 40 75mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106137;The 7.5 cm Pak 40 (7,5 cm Panzerabwehrkanone 40) was a German 75 millimetre anti-tank gun developed in 1939-1941 by Rheinmetall and used during the Second World War. The Pak 40 formed the backbone of German anti-tank guns for the latter part of World War II, mostly in towed form, but also on a number of tank destroyers like the Marder II and III. Approximately 23,500 Pak 40's were produced.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106138;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The Pak 43 88mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106138;The Pak 43 (Panzerabwehrkanone 43) was a German 88 mm anti-tank gun developed by Krupp in competition with the Rheinmetall 8.8 cm Flak 41 anti-aircraft gun and used during the Second World War. The Pak 43 was the most powerful anti-tank gun of the Wehrmacht to see service in significant numbers, also serving in modified form as the 8.8 cm KwK 43 main gun on the Tiger II tank, and Elefant, Jagdpanther and Nashorn tank destroyers.  The improved 8.8 cm gun had a very flat trajectory out to 914 m (1,000 yd), making it easier for the gunner to hit targets at longer ranges as less corrections in elevation were needed. In addition to this the gun's exceptional penetration performance made it able to frontally penetrate any Allied tank to see service during the war at long ranges, even the Soviet IS-2 tanks and IS chassis-based tank destroyers. The gun's maximum firing range exceeded 13 kilometers (8 miles).;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106139;New Anti-Tank Gun Design: The Pak 44 128mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106139;The 128mm Pak 44 L/55 (PaK, (Ger.) Panzerabwehrkanone) was a German heavy anti-tank gun used during World War II. It was designed as a result of experiences on the Eastern front in 1943. The German army had encountered the Russian 122 mm guns and had issued a requirement for a similar weapon. Development initially concentrated on a field gun known as the Kanone K 44. However once heavier Russian armour such as the IS-2 started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role.  The Pak 44 had short to medium-range performance similar to the 88mm Pak 43, but the 128mm Pak 44 better maintained its anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges (1800–2700+ metres) while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing HE.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9106140;The Flak 30 (Flugabwehrkanone 30) and improved Flak 38 were 20 mm anti-aircraft guns used by various German forces throughout World War II. It was not only the primary German light anti-aircraft gun, but by far the most numerously produced German artillery piece throughout the war. It was produced in a variety of models, notably the Flakvierling 38 which combined four Flak 38 autocannons onto a single carriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9106141;The 3.7 cm Flak 18/36/37/43 was a series of anti-aircraft cannon produced by Nazi Germany that saw widespread service in the Second World War. The cannon was fully automatic and effective against aircraft flying at altitudes up to 4,200 m. The cannon was produced in both towed and self-propelled versions. Having a flexible doctrine, the Germans used their anti-aircraft pieces in ground support roles as well, 37mm caliber guns were no exception to that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME9106143;New Anti-Air Gun Design: The FlaK 18/36/41 88mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106143;The 8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41 (commonly called the eighty-eight) was a German 88 mm anti-aircraft and anti-tank artillery gun from World War II. It was widely used by Germany throughout the war, and was one of the most recognized German weapons of that conflict. Development of the original model led to a wide variety of guns.  The name applies to a series of related guns, the first one officially called the 8.8 cm Flak 18, the improved 8.8 cm Flak 36, and later the 8.8 cm Flak 37. Flak is a contraction of German Flugzeugabwehrkanone meaning "aircraft-defense cannon", the original purpose of the eighty-eight. In English, "flak" became a generic term for ground anti-aircraft fire. In informal German use, the guns were universally known as the Acht-acht ("eight-eight").  The versatile carriage allowed the eighty-eight to be fired in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, it could be completely emplaced in only two-and-a-half minutes. Its successful use as an improvised anti-tank gun led to the development of a tank gun based upon it: the 88mm KwK 36, with the "KwK" abbreviation standing for Kampfwagen-Kanone (literally "battle vehicle cannon", or "main battle tank cannon"), meant to be placed in a gun turret as the tank's primary armament. This gun served as the main armament of the Tiger I heavy tank.  In addition to these Krupp designs, Rheinmetall later created a more powerful anti-aircraft gun, the 88mm Flak 41, which was produced in relatively small numbers. Krupp responded with another prototype of the long-barreled 88 mm gun, which was further developed into the anti-tank and tank destroyer 88mm PaK 43 gun used for the Elefant and Jagdpanther, and turret-mounted 88mm KwK 43 heavy tank gun of the Tiger II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106144;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The Sturmpanzer I 150mm sIG 33;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106144;The 150mm sIG 33 (Sf) auf Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf B (sometimes referred to as the Sturmpanzer I) was a German self-propelled heavy infantry gun used during World War II.  The Invasion of Poland had shown that the towed sIG 33 guns assigned to the infantry gun companies of the motorized infantry regiments had difficulties keeping up with the tanks during combat. The easiest solution was to modify a spare tank chassis to carry it into battle. A sIG 33 was mounted on the chassis of the Panzer I Ausf. B, complete with carriage and wheels, in place of the turret and superstructure. Plates 13 millimetres (0.51 in) thick were used to form a tall, open-topped fighting compartment on the forward part of the hull. This protected little more than the gun and the gunner himself from small arms fire and shell fragments, the loaders being completely exposed. The rearmost section of armor was hinged to ease reloading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106145;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The Sturmpanzer II 150mm sIG 33;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106145;The 15 cm sIG 33 auf Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II (Sf), sometimes referred to as the Sturmpanzer II, was a German self-propelled heavy infantry gun used during World War II.  The 15 cm sIG 33 (Sf) auf Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf B built in time for the Invasion of France in 1940 had proven to be too heavy for their chassis as well as enormously tall.  The same gun was mated to the Panzerkampfwagen II chassis in an attempt to drastically lower its height while using a stronger chassis. The prototype used a standard Panzer II Ausf. B chassis when it was built in February 1941, but this was too cramped for use. The chassis was lengthened by 60 centimetres (24 in), which required adding a sixth roadwheel, and widened by 32 centimetres (13 in) to better accommodate the gun while preserving its low silhouette. 15 millimetres (0.59 in) plates formed the front and sides of the open-topped fighting compartment, which was also open at the rear. Its sides were notably lower than the front which made the crew vulnerable to small arms fire and shell fragments. Large hatches were added to the rear deck to better cool the engine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106146;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The Sd.Kfz.124 Wespe 105mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106146;The Sd. Kfz. 124 Wespe (German for "wasp"), also known as Leichte Feldhaubitze 18/2 auf Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II (Sf.) ("Light field howitzer 18 on Panzer II chassis (self-propelled)"), was a German self-propelled artillery vehicle developed and used during the Second World War. It was based on a modified Panzer II chassis.  In 1940, during the Battle of France, it was apparent that the intermediate tank of the German forces, the Panzer II, was unsuitable as a main battle tank. Though mechanically sound, it was both under-gunned and under-armoured. The chassis, however, proved servicable for providing mobility to the 10.5 cm field howitzer. Existing chassis were converted to self-propelled artillery vehicles, just as had been done with the Marder II, which was a conversion designed to provide mobility to the PaK 40/7.5 cm anti-tank gun.  The design for the Wespe was produced by Alkett, and was based on the Panzer II Ausf. F chassis. Alkett had earlier worked with Alfred Becker to convert captured French armoured vehicles into self-propelled artillery carriers. Amongst other modifications to the Panzer II, the engine was moved forward and the chassis was slightly lengthened to gain sufficient space for the rear-mounted 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzer. The superstructure was lightly armored, with 10 mm armor plate (enough to stop small arms fire) and was open at the top and to the rear. The vehicles were produced by FAMO's Ursus plant in Warsaw.  The Wespe was in production from February 1943 until June 1944, when Soviet forces approached the frontier. By that time, 676 had been produced. An additional 159 were modified to serve as mobile artillery ammunition carriers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106147;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The Grille 150mm sIG 33 Ausf.M;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106147;The Grille (German: "cricket") was a series of self propelled artillery vehicles used by Nazi Germany during World War II. The Grille series was based on the Czech Panzer 38(t) tank and used a 15 cm sIG 33 infantry gun.  The second Grille variant was based on the Panzer 38(t) Ausf. M, which had its engine in the middle. As with the earlier version, the turret was removed and replaced with a new superstructure and armored compartment. Unlike the older variant, the fighting compartment was located at the rear of the vehicle, as well as somewhat smaller and higher. The main gun was also the 15 cm schweres Infanteriegeschütz 33.  From April to June 1943 and then from October 1943 to September 1944 a total of 282 vehicles were produced. This was the last vehicle built on the Ausf M chassis as the 10 that had been allocated to the Flakpanzer 38(t) chassis were used to build Grilles instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106148;New Self-Propelled Artillery Design: The Hummel 150mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106148;Hummel (German: "bumblebee") was a self-propelled artillery gun based on the Geschützwagen III/IV chassis and armed with a 15 cm howitzer. It was used by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War from early 1943 until the end of the war.  The Hummel was designed in 1942 out of a need for mobile artillery support for the tank forces, the lack of which had first been felt during the invasion of the USSR. There were some self-propelled artillery vehicles already in service with the Wehrmacht at the time, but most were of limited value.  The first option looked at was mounting a 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzer on a Panzer III chassis, but this was rejected in favour of the same howitzer on a Panzer IV chassis. One prototype was built of this design.  This design was again rejected, this time in favour of a more powerful solution: mounting the 15 cm sFH 18 L/30 howitzer on the specially designed Geschützwagen III/IV, which took elements of both the Panzer III (driving and steering system) and Panzer IV chassis (suspension and engine). The same chassis was also used for the Nashorn tank destroyer.  The Hummel had an open-topped lightly armoured fighting compartment at the back of the vehicle, which housed both the howitzer and the crew. The engine was moved to the centre of the vehicle to make room for this compartment. Late model Hummels had a slightly redesigned driver compartment and front superstructure, to offer more room to the radio operator and driver.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106149;New Assault Gun Design: The StuG III Ausf.B;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106149;The Sturmgeschutz III (StuG III) assault gun was Germany's most produced armoured fighting vehicle during World War II. It was built on the chassis of the proven Panzer III tank, replacing the turret with a fixed casemate and mounting a more powerful gun. Initially intended as a mobile, armoured light gun for direct-fire support for infantry, the StuG III was continually modified, and much like the later Jagdpanzer casemate-styled specialist armored vehicles, was widely employed as a tank destroyer.  Ausf B:  Widened tracks (380 mm). Two Rubber tires on each roadwheel were accordingly widened from 520x79mm to 520x95mm each. Both types of roadwheels were interchangeable. The troublesome 10-speed transmission was changed to a 6-speed one. The forwardmost return rollers were re-positioned further forward, reducing the vertical movements of the tracks before they were fed to the forward drive sprocket, and so reduced the chance of tracks being thrown. In the middle of production of the Ausf. B model, the original drive sprocket with eight round holes was changed to a new cast drive sprocket with six pie slice-shaped slots. This new drive wheel could take either 380 mm tracks or 400 mm wide tracks. 380mm tracks were not exclusive to new drive wheels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106150;New Assault Gun Design: The StuG III Ausf.E;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106150;Ausf E:  Superstructure sides added extended rectangular armoured boxes for radio equipment. Increased space allowed room for six additional rounds of ammunition for the main gun (giving a maximum of 50) plus a machine gun. One MG 34 and seven drum-type magazines were carried in the right rear side of the fighting compartment to protect the vehicle from enemy infantry. Vehicle commanders were officially provided with SF14Z stereoscopic scissor periscopes. Stereoscopic scissor type periscopes for artillery spotters may have been used by vehicle commanders from the start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106151;New Assault Gun Design: The StuG III Ausf.F;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106151;Ausf F:  The first real up-gunning of the StuG, this version uses the longer 7.5 cm StuK 40 L/43 gun. Firing armour-piercing Panzergranat-Patrone 39, StuK 40 L/43 could penetrate 91 mm of armour inclined 30 degrees from vertical at 500 m, 82mm at 1,000 m, 72 mm at 1,500 m, 63 mm at 2,000 m, allowing Ausf. F to engage most Soviet armoured vehicles at normal combat ranges. This change marked the StuG as being more of a tank destroyer than an infantry support vehicle. An exhaust fan was added to the rooftop to excavate fumes from spent shells, to enable the firing of continuous shots. Additional 30 mm armour plates were welded to the 50 mm frontal armour from June 1942, making the frontal armour 80 mm thick. From June 1942, Ausf. F were mounted with approximately 13 inch (334 mm to be exact) longer 7.5 cm StuK 40 L/48 gun. Firing above mentioned ammunition, longer L/48 could penetrate 96 mm, 85 mm, 74 mm, 64 mm respectively (30 degrees from vertical).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106152;New Assault Gun Design: The StuG III Ausf.G;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106152;Ausf G: Approximately 8423 historically produced, 142 built on Panzer III Ausf. M chassis, 173 converted from Panzer III): The final and by far the most common of the StuG series. Upper superstructure was widened: welded boxes on either sides were abandoned. This new superstructure design increased its height to 2160 mm. The back wall of the fighting compartment got straightened, and the ventilation fan on top of the superstructure was relocated to the back of the fighting compartment. From March 1943, the driver's periscope was abandoned. In February 1943, Alkett was joined by MIAG as a second manufacturer. From May 1943, side hull spaced armour plates (Schürzen) were fitted to G models for added armour protection, particularly against Russian anti-tank rifles, but were also useful against hollow-charge ammunition. Side plates were retro-fitted to some Ausf. F/8 models, as they were be fitted to all front line StuGs and other tanks by June 1943 in preparation for the battle of Kursk. Mountings for the side plates proved inadequately strong, as many were lost in the field. From March 1944, an improved mounting was introduced; as a result, side skirts are seen more often with late model Ausf G. From May 1943, 80 mm thick plates were used for frontal armour instead of two plates of 50 mm + 30 mm. However, a backlog of StuGs with completed 50 mm armour existed. For those, a 30 mm additional armour plate still had to be welded or bolted on, until October 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106153;New Assault Gun Design: The StuG IV;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106153;The Sturmgeschutz IV (StuG IV) (Sd.Kfz. 167), was a German assault gun variant of the Panzer IV used in the latter part of the Second World War. Identical in role and concept to the highly successful StuG III assault gun variant of the Panzer III, both StuG models were given an exclusively tank destroyer role in German formations and tactical planning in the last two years of the war, greatly augmenting the capability of the dwindling tank force available to the German army on the Eastern and Western fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106154;New Assault Gun Design: The StuH 42;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106154;In 1942, a variant of the StuG III Ausf. F was designed with a 105 mm (4.1 in) howitzer instead of the 7.5 cm StuK 40 L/43 cannon. These new vehicles, designated StuH 42 (Sturmhaubitze 42, Sd.Kfz 142/2), were designed to provide infantry support with the increased number of StuG III Ausf. F/8 and Ausf. Gs being used in the anti-tank role. The StuH 42 mounted a variant of the 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzer, modified to be electrically fired and fitted with a muzzle brake. Production models were built on StuG III Ausf. G chassis. The muzzle brake was often omitted due to the scarcity of resources later in the war. ~1,299 StuH 42 were produced by Alkett from March 1943 to 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9106155;The Sturmpanzer (also known as Sturmpanzer 43 or Sd.Kfz. 166) was a German armoured infantry support gun based on the Panzer IV chassis used in the Second World War. It was used at the Battles of Kursk, Anzio, Normandy, and helped to put down the Warsaw Uprising. It was known by the nickname Brummbar (German: "Grouch") by Allied intelligence, a name which was not used by the Germans. Historically, just over 300 vehicles were built and they were assigned to four independent battalions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9106156;Sturmtiger (German: "Assault Tiger") was a World War II German assault gun built on the Tiger I chassis and armed with a large rocket launcher. The official German designation was Sturmmorserwagen 606/4 mit 38 cm RW 61. Its primary task was to provide heavy fire support for infantry units fighting in urban areas. The few vehicles produced fought in the Warsaw Uprising, the Battle of the Bulge and the Battle of the Reichswald. The fighting vehicle is also known under a large number of informal names, among which the Sturmtiger became the most popular.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106157;New Self-Propelled Anti-Air Gun Design: The FlaKpanzer I 20mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106157;The Flakpanzer I was a rare self propelled anti-aircraft gun conversion of the Panzer I in use by Germany during World War II. Its designation was Sd.Kfz.101 (Special Purpose Vehicle 101). This self propelled anti-air truck is meant for destroying enemy fighters/dive bombers, low flying planes in general, and lightly armored units.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106158;New Self-Propelled Anti-Air Gun Design: The Flakpanzer IV 'Ostwind';;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106158;The Flakpanzer IV "Ostwind" (East Wind in German) was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun based on the Panzer IV tank. It was developed in 1944 as a successor to the earlier Flakpanzer IV/2cm Vierling Wirbelwind.  The Panzer IV's turret was removed and replaced with an open-top, hexagonal turret which housed a 37mm FlaK 43. In addition to its intended role as an anti-aircraft weapon, the fast-firing gun was highly effective against light vehicles and minor fortifications. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but this was not possible due to the heavy smoke generated by the gun.  The Ostwind's main improvement over the Wirbelwind was the FlaK 43's increased range and stopping power over the 2 cm Flakvierling 38 and slightly better armor on its turret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106159;New Self-Propelled Anti-Air Gun Design: The Flakpanzer IV 'Wirbelwind';;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106159;The Flakpanzer IV "Wirbelwind" (Whirlwind in English) was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun based on the Panzer IV tank. It was developed in 1944 as a successor to the earlier self-propelled anti-aircraft gun Mobelwagen.  In the first years of the war, the Wehrmacht had less interest in developing self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, but as the Allies began to gain air superiority, the need for more mobile and better-armed self-propelled anti-aircraft guns increased. During the early summer of 1944, SS-Hauptsturmführer Karl Wilhelm Krause with the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend came up with the concept of the Flakpanzer IV Wirbelwind. He presented the concept to SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer Max Wünsche, commanding officer of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment and it was approved by Hitler.  The Panzer IV's turret was removed and replaced with an open-top, nine-sided turret which housed a quadruple 20mm Flakvierling 38 L/112.5. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but this was not possible due to the heavy smoke generated by the four anti-aircraft guns. The shape of the turret earned it the nickname of Keksdose (Biscuit Tin). Production of the tank was carried out by Ostbau Werke in Sagan, Silesia. However, in combat the 20mm shells were felt to be insufficiently effective against aircraft and so a more powerful successor was produced which eventually replaced it. Known as the Flakpanzer IV Ostwind (East Wind), the successor was equipped with a single 37mm FlaK 43.  The combination of armor and rapid fire from the four guns of the Wirbelwind also made it effective against ground targets.  Between 87 and 105 Wirbelwinds were produced during the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9106160;Flakpanzer Coelian was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun design by Rheinmetall during World War II for the German armed forces. It was intended to be armed with two 37mm FlaK 43 gun in a fully enclosed, rotating turret on the hull of a Panther medium tank but was historically not built before the end of the war in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106161;New Infantry Tank Design: The Panzer IV Ausf.D;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106161;The Panzerkampfwagen IV (PzKpfw IV), commonly known as the Panzer IV, was a German medium tank developed in the late 1930s and used extensively during the Second World War. Its ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz. 161.  Ausf D:  This variant, of which 248 vehicles were produced, retained the low velocity 75mm gun and reintroduced the hull machine gun and changed the turret's internal gun mantlet to an external one. Again, protection was upgraded, this time by increasing side armor to 20 mm (0.79 in). As the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 came to an end, it was decided to scale up production of the Panzer IV, which was adopted for general use on 27 September 1939 as the Sonderkraftfahrzeug 161 (Sd.Kfz. 161).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106162;New Light Tank Design: The PzKpfw.I 'Panzer I';;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106162;The Panzer I was a light tank produced in Germany in the 1930s. The name is short for the German Panzerkampfwagen I ("armored fighting vehicle mark I"), abbreviated PzKpfw I. The tank's official German ordnance inventory designation was SdKfz 101 ("special purpose vehicle 101").  Design of the Panzer I began in 1932 and mass production began in 1934. Intended only as a training tank to introduce the concept of armored warfare to the German Army, the Panzer I saw combat in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, in Poland, France, the Soviet Union and North Africa during the Second World War, and in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Experiences with the Panzer I during the Spanish Civil War helped shape the German armored corps' invasion of Poland in 1939 and France in 1940. By 1941, the Panzer I chassis design was used as the basis of tank destroyers and assault guns. There were attempts to upgrade the Panzer I throughout its service history, including by foreign nations, to extend the design's lifespan. It continued to serve in the Spanish Armed Forces until 1954.  The Panzer I's performance in combat was limited by its thin armor and light armament of two machine guns. As a design intended for training, the Panzer I was not as capable as other light tanks of the era, such as the Soviet T-26. Although weak in combat, it formed a large part of Germany's tank forces and was used in all major campaigns between September 1939 and December 1941. The small, vulnerable light tank would be surpassed in importance by better-known German tanks, such as the Panzer IV, Panther, and Tiger; nevertheless, the Panzer I's contribution to the early victories of Nazi Germany during the Second World War was significant. Later in that war the turrets of the then obsolete PzKpfw Is and PzKpfw IIs were repurposed as gun turrets on specially built defensive bunkers, particularly on the Atlantic Wall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106163;New Light Tank Design: The PzKpfw.II 'Panzer II';;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106163;The Panzer II is the common name used for a family of German tanks used in World War II. The official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen II (abbreviated PzKpfw II).  Although the vehicle had originally been designed as a stopgap while larger, more advanced tanks were developed, it nonetheless went on to play an important role in the early years of World War II, during the Polish and French campaigns. The Panzer II was the most numerous tank in the German Panzer divisions beginning with the invasion of France. It was used in both North Africa against the British and on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union.  The Panzer II was supplanted by the Panzer III and IV by 1940/1941. Thereafter, it was used to great effect as a reconnaissance tank. By the end of 1942, it had been largely removed from front line service and it was used for training and on secondary fronts. The turrets of the then obsolete PzKpfw Is and PzKpfw IIs were reused as gun turrets on specially built defensive bunkers, particularly on the Atlantic Wall. Production of the tank itself ceased by 1943, but its chassis remained in use as the basis of several other armored vehicles, chiefly self-propelled artillery and tank destroyers such as the Wespe and Marder II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106164;New Light Tank Design: The E-5 Standardpanzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106164;The Entwicklung series, more commonly known as the E-series, was a late-World War II attempt by Germany to produce a standardised series of tank designs. There were to be standard designs in six different weight classes, from which several specialised variants were to be developed. This intended to reverse the trend of extremely complex tank designs that had resulted in poor production rates and mechanical unreliability.  The E-5 was supposed to be 5-10 tonnes in weight and form the basis of a family of light tanks, reconnaissance vehicles, casemate-form turretless Jagdpanzer-style tank destroyers and armored personnel carriers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106165;New Medium Tank Design: The PzKpfw.III 'Panzer III';;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106165;Panzer III was the common name of a medium tank that was developed in the 1930s by Germany and was used extensively in World War II. The official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen III Sd Kfz. 141 (abbreviated PzKpfw III) translating as "armoured fighting vehicle". It was intended to fight other armoured fighting vehicles and serve alongside the support Panzer IV, however, as the Germans faced the formidable T-34, stronger anti-tank guns were needed. Since the Panzer IV had a bigger turret ring, the roles were reversed. The Panzer IV mounted the long barrelled 7.5 cm KwK 40 gun and engaged in tank-to-tank battles. The Panzer III became obsolete in this role and for most purposes was supplanted by the Panzer IV. From 1942, the last version of Panzer III mounted the 75mm KwK 37 L/24, better suited for infantry support. Production of the Panzer III ended in 1943. However, the Panzer III's capable chassis provided hulls for the Sturmgeschütz III assault gun until the end of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106166;New Medium Tank Design: The PzKpfw.IV 'Panzer IV';;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106166;The Panzerkampfwagen IV (PzKpfw IV), commonly known as the Panzer IV, was a German medium tank developed in the late 1930s and used extensively during the Second World War. Its ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz. 161.  Designed as an infantry support tank, the Panzer IV was not intended to engage enemy armor—that role being allocated to the Panzer III. However, with the inadequacy of the Panzer III becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the original role of its increasingly vulnerable cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed German tank of the Second World War, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles, including the Sturmgeschütz IV assault gun, Jagdpanzer IV tank destroyer, the Wirbelwind self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, and the Brummbar self-propelled gun.  The Panzer IV saw service in all combat theaters involving Germany and was the only German tank to remain in continuous production throughout the war, with over 8800 produced between 1936 and 1945. Upgrades and design modifications intended to counter new threats, extended its service life. Generally, these involved increasing the Panzer IV's armor protection or upgrading its weapons, although during the last months of the war, with Germany's pressing need for rapid replacement of losses, design changes also included simplifications to speed up the manufacturing process.  The Panzer IV was generally succeeded by the Panther medium tank introduced to counter the T-34. The Panzer IV was the most widely exported tank in German service, with around 300 sold to Finland, Romania, Spain and Bulgaria. After the war, Syria procured Panzer IVs from France and Czechoslovakia, which saw combat in the 1967 Six-Day War. Some 8,553 Panzer IVs of all versions were built during World War II, with only the StuG III assault-gun/tank destroyer's 10,086 vehicle production run exceeding the Panzer IV's total among Axis armored forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106167;New Medium Tank Design: The PzKpfw.V 'Panther';;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106167;The Panther was a German medium tank deployed during World War II from mid-1943 to the end of the European war in 1945. It was intended as a counter to the Soviet T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger I until the end of the war. While the Panther is considered one of the best tanks of World War II due to its excellent firepower and protection, it was less impressive in terms of mobility, reliability, and cost.  Until 1944, it was designated as the Panzerkampfwagen V Panther and had the ordnance inventory designation of Sd.Kfz. 171. On 27 February 1944, Hitler ordered that the Roman numeral "V" be deleted from the designation.  The Panther was a compromise. While having essentially the same engine as the Tiger I tank, it had better frontal hull armour, (sloping glacis was equivalent to 205–221mm of vertical steel plate) better gun penetration, was lighter and faster, and could traverse rough terrain better than the Tiger. The tradeoff was weaker side armour, which made it vulnerable to flanking fire. The Panther proved to be effective in open country and long range engagements, but providing less high explosive firepower against infantry.  The Panther was far cheaper to produce than the Tiger I tank, and only slightly more expensive than the Panzer IV. Key elements of the Panther design, such as its armour, transmission, and final drive, were compromises made to improve production rates and address raw material shortages, whereas other overengineered elements, such as its highly compact engine and its complex suspension system, remained. The result was that Panther tank production was far higher than what was possible for the Tiger I, but not much higher than that of the Panzer IV. At the same time, the simplified final drive became the single major cause of breakdowns of the Panther tank. All of these compromises resulted in the Panther being less reliable than the Tiger I, which was generally satisfactory when given appropriate logistical support and after its initial flaws were addressed. The Panther tank arrived in 1943 and was rushed into combat at the Battle of Kursk with its initial problems uncorrected, which resulted in a high breakdown rate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106168;New Medium Tank Design: The E-50 Standardpanzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106168;The Entwicklung series, more commonly known as the E-series, was a late-World War II attempt by Germany to produce a standardised series of tank designs. There were to be standard designs in six different weight classes, from which several specialised variants were to be developed. This intended to reverse the trend of extremely complex tank designs that had resulted in poor production rates and mechanical unreliability.  The E-50 Standardpanzer was intended as a standard medium tank, replacing the Panther and Tiger I and the conversions based on these tanks. The E-50 hull was to be longer than the Panther, in fact it was practically identical to the Königstiger (Tiger II) in overall dimensions except for the glacis plate layout. Compared to these earlier designs however, the amount of drilling and machining involved in producing these Standardpanzer was reduced drastically, which would have made them quicker, easier and cheaper to produce, as would the proposed conical spring system, replacing their predecessors' torsion bar system which required a special steel alloy.  Other sources show that a variant of the narrow-mantlet 'Schmalturm' turret designed for the Panther Ausf. F would have been used, coupled with a variant of the 88 mm L/71 gun.  As indicated by its name, the weight of the E-50 would fall between 50 and 75 tonnes. The engine was an improved Maybach HL234 which had 900 hp. Maximum speed was supposed to be 60 km/h.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106169;New Heavy Tank Design: The PzKpfw.VI 'Tiger' Ausf.E;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106169;Tiger I is the common name of a German heavy tank developed in 1942 and used in World War II. The final official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf. E, often shortened to Tiger. The Tiger I gave the Wehrmacht its first tank which mounted the 88 mm gun in its first armoured fighting vehicle-dedicated version: the KwK 36. During the course of the war, the Tiger I saw combat on all German battlefronts. It was usually deployed in independent heavy tank battalions, which proved highly effective.  While the Tiger I has been called an outstanding design, it was over-engineered, using expensive materials and labour-intensive production methods. Only 1,347 were built between August 1942 and August 1944. The Tiger was prone to certain types of track failures and breakdowns, and limited in range by its high fuel consumption. It was expensive to maintain, but generally mechanically reliable. It was also difficult to transport, and vulnerable to immobilization when mud, ice and snow froze between its overlapping and interleaved Schachtellaufwerk-pattern road wheels in both rasputitsa and succeeding winter weather conditions, often jamming them solid. In 1944, production was phased out in favour of the Tiger II.  The tank was given its nickname "Tiger" by Ferdinand Porsche, and the Roman numeral was added after the later Tiger II entered production. The initial official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausführung H (‘‘Panzer VI version H’’, abbreviated PzKpfw VI Ausf. H), with the H being for the designer/manufacturer, Henschel. It was classed with ordnance inventory designation SdKfz 182. The tank was later redesignated as PzKpfw VI Ausf. E in March 1943, with ordnance inventory designation SdKfz 181..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106170;New Heavy Tank Design: The E-75 Standardpanzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106170;The Entwicklung series, more commonly known as the E-series, was a late-World War II attempt by Germany to produce a standardised series of tank designs. There were to be standard designs in six different weight classes, from which several specialised variants were to be developed. This intended to reverse the trend of extremely complex tank designs that had resulted in poor production rates and mechanical unreliability.  The E-75 Standardpanzer was intended to be the standard heavy tank to be used as a replacement of the Tiger II and Jagdtiger. The E-75 would have been built on the same production lines as the E-50 for ease of manufacture, and the two vehicles were to share many components, including the same Maybach HL 234 engine. As its name indicates, the resulting vehicle would have weighed in at over 75 tonnes, reducing its speed to around 40 km/h. To offset the increased weight, the bogies were spaced differently from on the E-50, with an extra pair added on each side, giving the E-75 a slightly improved track to ground contact length.  According to some sources, the similarities between the E-50 and the E-75 went further, they were to be equipped with the same turret and 88mm KwK 43 L/71 along with an optical rangefinder for increased long range accuracy. German scientists and engineers had successfully designed a Schmalturm, narrow-front turret and infra-red lighting and sights for use on the prototypes of the Panther Ausf. F as the war drew to a close.  The original complex suspension by torsion bars was simplified with bogies. The standard Tiger II turret was equipped with 88mm KwK 44 L71 gun. The engine was an improved, fuel-injected Maybach HL234 which had 900 hp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106171;New Heavy Tank Design: The Tiger II 'Kingtiger';;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106171;Tiger II is the common name of a German heavy tank of the Second World War. The final official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. B, often shortened to Tiger B. The ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz. 182. It is also known under the informal name Königstiger (the German name for the Bengal tiger), often translated literally as Royal Tiger, or somewhat incorrectly as King Tiger by Allied soldiers. The Tiger II was the successor to the Tiger I, combining the latter's thick armor with the armor sloping used on the Panther medium tank. The tank weighed almost 70 metric tons, and was protected by 100 to 180 mm (3.9 to 7.1 in) of armor to the front. It was armed with the long barreled 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71 gun. The chassis was also the basis for the Jagdtiger turretless tank destroyer. The Tiger II was issued to heavy tank battalions of the Army (Schwere Heerespanzerabteilung – abbreviated s.H.Pz.Abt) and the Waffen-SS (s.SS.Pz.Abt). It was first used in combat with s.H.Pz.Abt. 503 during the Normandy campaign on 11 July 1944, on the Eastern Front, the first unit to be outfitted with Tiger IIs was the s.H.Pz.Abt. 501, which by 1 September 1944 listed 25 Tiger IIs operational.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106172;New Heavy Tank Design: The PzKpfgw.VIII 'Maus';;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106172;Panzerkampfwagen VIII Maus ("Mouse") was a German World War II super-heavy tank completed in late 1944. It is the heaviest fully enclosed armoured fighting vehicle ever built. Only two hulls and one turret were completed before the testing grounds were captured by the advancing Soviet forces.  These two prototypes – one with, one without turret – underwent trials in late 1944. The complete vehicle was 10.2 metres (33 ft 6 in) long, 3.71 metres (12 ft 2 in) wide and 3.63 metres (11.9 ft) high. Weighing 188 metric tons, the Maus's main armament was the Krupp-designed 128 mm KwK 44 L/55 gun, based on the 12.8 cm Pak 44 anti-tank field artillery piece also used in the casemate-type Jagdtiger tank destroyer, with a coaxial 75 mm KwK 44 L/36.5 gun. The 128 mm gun was powerful enough to destroy all Allied armored fighting vehicles then in service, some at ranges exceeding 3,500 metres (3,800 yd).  The principal problem in the design of the Maus was developing an engine and drivetrain which was powerful enough to propel the tank, yet small enough to fit inside it — as it was meant to use the same sort of "hybrid drive", using an internal-combustion engine to operate an electric generator to power its tracks with electric motor units, much as its Ferdinand Porsche-designed predecessors, the VK 3001 (P), VK 4501 (P), and Elefant had. The drive train was electrical, designed to provide a maximum speed of 20 kilometres per hour (12 mph) and a minimum speed of 1.5 kilometres per hour (0.93 mph). However, during actual field testing, the maximum speed achieved on hard surfaces was 13 kilometres per hour (8.1 mph) with full motor field, and by weakening the motor field to a minimum, a top speed of 22 kilometres per hour (14 mph) was achieved.[4] The vehicle's weight made it unable to utilize most bridges, instead it was intended to ford to a depth of 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) or submerge up to a depth of 8 metres (26 ft 3 in) and use a snorkel to cross rivers.  The Maus was intended to punch holes through enemy defences in the manner of an immense "breakthrough tank", whilst taking almost no damage to any components. Five were ordered, but only two hulls and one turret were completed before the advancing Allies found them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106173;New Light Tank Destroyer Design: The Panzerjager I;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106173;The Panzerjager I (German "Tank Hunter 1") was the first of the German tank destroyers to see service in the Second World War. It mounted a Czech Skoda 4.7 cm (1.9 in) cm PaK (t) anti-tank gun on a converted Panzer I Ausf. B chassis. It was intended to counter heavy French tanks like the Char B1 that were beyond the capabilities of the 3.7mm PaK 36 anti-tank gun then in service and served to extend the usable lifetime of otherwise obsolete Panzer I tanks. 202 Panzer I's were converted to the Panzerjager I in 1940 and 1941. They were employed in the Battle of France, in the North Africa Campaign and on the Eastern Front.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106174;New Light Tank Destroyer Design: The Marder I;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106174;The Marder I "Marten" (SdKfz 135) was a German World War II tank destroyer, armed with the 75mm anti-tank gun. Most Marder Is were built on the base of the Tracteur Blinde 37L (Lorraine), a French artillery tractor/armoured personnel carrier of which the Germans had acquired more than three hundred after the Fall of France in 1940.  From the early stages of Operation Barbarossa the Wehrmacht became aware that their abililty to combat some of the Soviet tanks was inadequate. The lighter tanks then in general service, such as the Panzer II and the Czech built 38(t) were under-armoured and did not mount an adequate gun to deal with the newer Soviet tanks. In addition, the standard towed anti-tank gun of the Wehrmacht, the 37 mm Pak 36, was both difficult to get into position quickly and lacked the ability to penetrate the heavy sloped armour of the new Soviet tanks. What was needed was a more powerful anti-tank gun that was mobile. The Germans possessed such a gun in the 75 mm PaK 40. They also had come into possession of a large number of captured Soviet 76 mm F-22 Model 1936 divisional field guns. The Germans had experience in taking the chassis of an undergunned tank to provide mobility to a heavier gun. The Panzerjäger I is such an example, where the turret was removed for an open top conversion to allow the gunners the necessary room to operate the gun.  With the shock of having units overrun by new Soviet T-34s and KV-1s, the need for a heavier-gunned German tank became urgent. As an interim solution, it was decided to use captured French vehicles such as the Lorraine, and less effective Wehrmacht tanks such as the Panzer II and 38(t) as the basis for makeshift tank destroyers. The result was the Marder series, comprising the Marder I, Marder II, and Marder III respectively. These vehicles provided mobility to either the captured Soviet 7.62 cm Pak 36(r) gun or in later versions the German 75 mm PaK 40 anti-tank gun. The Marder series were not a proper Panzerjager that could exchange shells with enemy tanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106175;New Light Tank Destroyer Design: The Marder II;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106175;The Marder II was a German tank destroyer of World War II based on the Panzer II chassis. There were two versions, the first mounted modified Soviet 7.62 cm guns firing German ammunition, while the other mounted the German 7.5 cm Pak 40 gun. Its high profile and thin open-topped armor provided minimal protection to the crew. Nevertheless, the Marder II (and similar Marder III) provided a great increase in firepower over contemporary German tanks through the 1942/43 time frame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106176;New Light Tank Destroyer Design: The Marder III;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106176;Marder III was the name for a series of World War II German tank destroyers. They mounted either Soviet 76.2mm F-22 Model 1936 divisional field guns, or German 7.5 cm PaK 40, in an open-topped cupola on top of the chassis of the Panzer 38(t). They offered little protection to the crew, but added significant firepower compared to contemporary German tanks. They were in production from 1942 to 1944 and served on all fronts until the end of the war, along with the similar Marder II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106177;New Medium Tank Destroyer Design: The Jagdpanzer IV;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106177;The Jagdpanzer IV, Sd.Kfz. 162, was a tank destroyer based on the Panzer IV chassis built in three main variants. As one of the casemate-style turretless Jagdpanzer (tank destroyer, literally "hunting tank") designs, it was developed against the wishes of Heinz Guderian, the inspector general of the Panzertruppen, as a replacement for the Sturmgeschutz III (StuG III). Guderian objected against the needless, in his eyes, diversion of resources from Panzer IV tank production, as the Stug III and Sturmgeschutz IV were still more than adequate for their role.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106178;New Light Tank Destroyer Design: The Hetzer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106178;The Jagdpanzer 38 (Sd.Kfz. 138/2), later known as Hetzer ("baiter"), was a German light tank destroyer of the Second World War based on a modified Czechoslovakian Panzer 38(t) chassis.  The Jagdpanzer 38 was intended to be more cost-effective than the much more ambitious Jagdpanther and Jagdtiger designs of the same period. Using a proven chassis, it avoided the mechanical problems of the larger armoured vehicles.  Hetzer was built on the Panzerkampfwagen 38(t)‘s widened and lengthened chassis with modified suspension (larger road-wheels from Praga TNH n.A prototype reconnaissance tank) and up-rated engine. The new engine was 160hp Praga AC/2 6-cylinder engine controlled by Praga-Wilson gearbox (5 forward and 1 reverse gear). Chassis was modified in order to accommodate larger gun and thicker armour than regular Panzerkampfwagen 38(t) tank. Its combat weight was 16 metric tons (verses 9.8-tons for the Pz 38(t)) and it could travel at maximum speed of some 42km/h.  It was better armored than the thinly armoured earlier Panzerjäger Marder and Nashorn with a sloped armour front plate of 60 mm sloped back at 60 degrees from the vertical (equivalent in protection to about 120 mm), carried a reasonably powerful 75mm gun, was mechanically reliable, small and easily concealed. It was also cheap to build.  The Jagdpanzer 38 succeeded the open-top Marder III (based on the same chassis) in production from April 1944, about 2584 were built until the end of the war. The older Marder III Panzerjäger series retained the same vertically sided chassis as Panzer 38(t). In the Jagdpanzer 38, the lower hull sides slope 15 degrees outward to make roughly hexagonal shape when viewed from front or rear. This increased the available interior space and enabled a fully enclosed casemate-style fighting compartment. Because of the fully enclosed armor, it was 5 tonnes heavier than the Marder III. To compensate for the increased weight, track width was increased from 293 mm to 350 mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106179;New Medium Tank Destroyer Design: The Jagdpanther;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106179;The Jagdpanther (German: "hunting panther") was a tank destroyer built by Nazi Germany during World War II based on the chassis of the Panther tank. It entered service late in the war (1944) and saw service on the Eastern and Western Fronts. The Jagdpanther combined the very powerful 88mm PaK 43 cannon of the Tiger II and the characteristically excellent armor and suspension of the Panther chassis, although it suffered from the general poor state of German ordnance production, maintenance and training in the later part of the war, which resulted in small production numbers, shortage in spare parts and poor crew readiness. It was armed with the same long-barreled 8.8 cm gun as the Tiger II "King Tiger". The gun was mounted in a central mantlet, which gave it a limited traverse of 11 degrees to each side. A single 7.92 mm MG-34 machine gun for local defence was in a ball mount on the right side of the front glacis plate. The machine gunner was also the wireless operator. The driver sat on the left. The gunner had a rangefinder and a periscope telescopic sight. The periscope - linked to the gun mount - was under an armoured housing on the roof.  The Jagdpanther had a good power-to-weight ratio and a powerful main gun, which enabled it to destroy any type of Allied tank. Based on the existing Panther Ausf G chassis, the vehicle did not suffer too many mechanical problems. It had an upgraded transmission (the ZF AK 7-400 heavy duty) - which had been planned for the Panther II - and final drive to counter the Panther's main weakness. It was manned by a crew of five: a driver, radio-operator, commander, gunner and a loader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106180;New Heavy Tank Destroyer Design: The Elephant;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106180;The Elefant was a Heavy Tank Destroyer of WWII.  Porsche GmbH had manufactured about one hundred chassis for their unsuccessful proposal for the Tiger tank, the "Porsche Tiger", in the Nibelungenwerk factory in Sankt Valentin, Austria. Both the successful Henschel proposal and the Porsche design used the same Krupp-designed turret—the Henschel design had its turret more-or-less centrally located on its hull, while the Porsche design placed the turret much closer to the front of the superstructure. Since the competing Henschel Tiger design was chosen for production, the Porsche chassis were no longer required for the Tiger tank project. It was therefore decided that the Porsche chassis were to be used as the basis of a new heavy tank destroyer, Ferdinand, mounting Krupp's newly developed 88 mm (3.5 in) Pak 43/2 anti-tank gun. This precise long-range weapon was intended to destroy enemy tanks before they came within their own range of effective fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106181;New Heavy Tank Destroyer Design: The Jagtiger;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106181;Jagdtiger ("Hunting Tiger") is the common name of a German heavy tank destroyer of World War II. The official German designation was Panzerjäger Tiger Ausf. B as it was based on a lengthened Tiger II chassis. The ordnance inventory designation was Sd. Kfz. 186. The 71-tonne Jagdtiger was the heaviest armored fighting vehicle used operationally during World War II and is the heaviest armored vehicle of any type to achieve series production. The vehicle carried a 128 mm PaK 44 L/55 main gun, capable of out-ranging and defeating any fielded Allied tank. It saw service in small numbers from late 1944 to the end of the war on both the Western and Eastern Front. Tiger ace Otto Carius commanded a company of Jagdtigers. His post-war memoir provides a rare combat history of the Jagdtigers that were under his command. Although 150 were ordered, only between 77 and 88 were produced. Due to an excessive weight, the Jagdtiger was continuously plagued with mechanical problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9106182;The G3 is a 7.62x51mm NATO battle rifle developed in the 1950s by the German armament manufacturer Heckler & Koch GmbH.  The origin of this rifle can be traced back to the final years of World War II when Mauser engineers at the Light Weapon Development Group (Abteilung 37) at Oberndorf am Neckar designed the MKb Gerät 06 (Maschinenkarabiner Gerat 06 or "machine carbine device 06") prototype assault rifle chambered for the intermediate 7.92x33mm Kurz cartridge, first with the Gerat 06 model using a roller-locked short recoil mechanism originally adapted from the MG 42 machine gun but with a fixed barrel and conventional gas-actuated piston rod. It was realized that with careful attention to the mechanical ratios, the gas system could be omitted.[4] The resultant weapon, the Gerät 06H (the "H" suffix is an abbreviation for halbverriegelt or "half-locked") was assigned the designation StG 45(M) (Sturmgewehr 45(M) or assault rifle) but was not produced in any significant numbers and the war ended before the first production rifles were completed.  The G3 is a modular weapon system. Its butt-stock, fore-stock and pistol-grip/fire-control assembly may be changed at will in a variety of configurations. Simple push-pins hold the components in place and removing them will allow the user to remove and replace parts rapidly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106183;New Advanced Anti-Tank Rocket Design: The Panzerfaust 2 (PzF 44 2A1) 67mm;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106183;The anti-tank grenade launcher was originally developed around 1960 and put into service by the Bundeswehr shortly thereafter. It was developed to provide West German infantry with a modern replacement for the Bazooka that they had previously used. As such, it was the first German antitank rocket developed after World War II, a conflict in which German hand-held antitank weapons such as the Panzerfaust played a prominent role during 1944–45. The Lanze was a product of a period in which the German army was re-equipped with locally-developed arms and equipment and retired the aging U.S. gear that had formed their initial arsenal. The full designation name by the German Army is Panzerfaust 44mm DM2 Ausführung 1 Lanze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106184;New Advanced General Purpose Machine Gun Design: The Heckler & Koch 21;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106184;The HK21 is a German 7.62 mm general-purpose machine gun, developed in 1961 by small arms manufacturer Heckler & Koch and based on the G3 battle rifle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106185;New Advanced Submachine Gun Design: The Heckler & Koch MP 5;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106185;The Heckler & Koch MP5 (from German: Maschinenpistole 5, "machine pistol model 5") is a 9mm submachine gun of German design, developed in the 1960s by a team of engineers from the German small arms manufacturer Heckler & Koch GmbH (H&K) of Oberndorf am Neckar. There are over 100 variants of the MP5, including a semi-automatic version.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106186;New Advanced General Purpose Machine Gun Design: The MG 3;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106186;The MG 3 is a German general-purpose machine gun chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge. The weapon's design is derived from the World War II era MG 42 universal machine gun that fired the 7.92x57mm Mauser round.  In 1968, the MG 3 was introduced and entered production. Compared to the MG1A3, the MG 3 features an improved feeding mechanism with a belt retaining pawl to hold the belt up to the gun when the top cover plate is lifted, an added anti-aircraft sight and a new ammunition box. MG 3s were produced for Germany and for export customers by Rheinmetall until 1979. Some additional production of the MG 3 in Germany was carried out by Heckler & Koch. The MG 3 and its variants all share a high level of parts interchangeability with the original MG 42.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106187;New Advanced Submachine Gun Design: The Walther MP;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106187;The Walther MP (Maschinenpistole) series is a family of 9x19mm Parabellum submachine guns produced in West Germany from 1963 to 1985 by Walther.  There are two versions of the Walther MP: the MPK (Maschinenpistole Kurz or "short machine pistol") and the MPL (Maschinenpistole Lang or "long machine pistol"). The only difference between MPK and MPL guns is the length of the barrel. They are blowback designs firing from "L"-shaped bolts. The bolts are above the barrel, permitting a shorter receiver. The receiver, made from stamped steel, forms a ventilated cooling jacket and the prominent cocking handle is located on its left front. A selective fire switch is also on both the left and right side of the receiver, behind the trigger, allowing for ambidextrous use.  Both guns feature side-folding buttstocks, made from thin steel tubes, and both guns feature flip-up sights. The MPL has 100 and 200 meter settings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106188;New Self-Propelled Rocket Artillery Design: The LARS-1 SP;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106188;The Light Artillery Rocket System (or LARS) is a series of West-German vehicle mounted multi-barrel rocket launchers designed for rapid concentration of fire on designated targets. The rockets are of 110 mm caliber. The usual mounting was a lightly armoured Magirus or MAN 6x6 truck. 36 rockets were mounted in two clusters of 18. The weapon entered service in 1969 and was phased out by 1998 and replaced by the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106189;New Armored Personnel Carrier Design: The Schutzenpanzer SPz 12-3;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106189;The Schutzenpanzer Lang HS.30 (also Schutzenpanzer 12-3) was a German infantry fighting vehicle developed during the 1950s. It was a Swiss Hispano-Suiza design, with a Rolls-Royce engine. After some early mechanical problems only some 2000 were built of the 10,000 planned. It was armed with a 20 mm cannon which was an unusually powerful weapon for an armoured personnel carrier of the period. Its design proved to have many flaws and drawbacks and the construction was followed by a great political scandal in West Germany in the 1960s. 2176 SPz 12-3 and variants were built until 1962, for which the German government paid 517 million DM, or about 238,000 DM per vehicle. The SPz 12-3 was first deployed in 1958 and was replaced by the Marder infantry fighting vehicle from 1971.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106190;New Advanced Tank Destroyer Design: The Kanonenjagdpanzer JPK;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106190;The Kanonenjagdpanzer (also known as Jagdpanzer Kanone 90mm, or tank destroyer, gun) was a German Cold War tank destroyer equipped with a 90mm anti-tank gun from obsolete M47 Patton tanks. Its design was very similar to that of the World War II Jagdpanzer IV.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106191;New Main Battle Tank Design: The Leopard 1 Main Battle Tank;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106191;The Leopard (or Leopard 1) is a main battle tank designed and produced in West Germany that first entered service in 1965. Developed in an era when HEAT warheads were thought to make conventional heavy armour of limited value, the Leopard focused on firepower in the form of the German-built version of the British L7 105-mm gun, and improved cross-country performance that was unmatched by other designs of the era.  The design started as a collaborative project in the 1950s between West Germany and France, and later joined by Italy, but the partnership ended and the final design was ordered by the Bundeswehr, with production starting in 1965. In total, 6,485 Leopard tanks have been built, of which 4,744 were battle tanks and 1,741 were utility and anti-aircraft variants, not including 80 prototypes and pre-series vehicles.  The Leopard quickly became a standard of European forces, and eventually served as the main battle tank in over a dozen countries worldwide. Since 1990, the Leopard 1 has gradually been relegated to secondary roles in most armies. In the German Army, the Leopard 1 MBTs were phased out in 2003, while Leopard 1 derived vehicles are still widely used.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9106192;New Advanced Tank Destroyer Design: The Raketenjagdpanzer 1;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9106192;The Raketenjagdpanzer 1 was an anti-tank guided missile-armed tank destroyer (the first such vehicle in service with the West German Armed Forces) that entered service in 1961.  The twin mounted launchers for the SS.11 anti-tank guided weapons were the primary armament for the Raketenjagdpanzer 1. With ten missiles per vehicle, the crew had the theoretical ability to destroy ten enemy vehicles, although this was doubtful in practice. The weapon was wire-guided and the crew continued to control the missile via a small periscope after launch. The SS.11 missile could penetrate 600 mm of rolled homogeneous armor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
