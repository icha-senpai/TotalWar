EVTDESC91075120;Now that we are at war we can decide if we want to have our factories manned with skilled professionals or unskilled conscripted laborers.  Each has their benefit and drawback.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME91075124;Scientist Recruitment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91075124;Science is important for our economy and our military.  There are two ways to go about increasing our scientific knowledge, but we can only choose one.  We can recruit scientists who mainly work at our universities into the government or we can recruit famous independent scientists to come work for the government.  Famous scientists who worked outside of universities include such personalities as Albert Einstein, Wernher Von Braun, and Robert Oppenheimer.  Check the Nation Tech Tree before you make your decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME91075125;Use of Mechanized Infantry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91075125;After fighting on many battlefields our miltary theorists have come up with a different approach in how Infantry can be used.  This new approach calls for using armored halftracks to transport and/or carry infantry to and into battle.  However, there are two different ways we can go about this, one is to use Mechanized Infantry as part of greater Combined Arms Force that will offer commanders more choices when deciding upon a tactical strategy.  The other way of doing business with Mechanized Infantry, dictates that they be used as an independent highly mobile force capable of effective assaults in many kinds of tactical situations.  Check the Tactical Doctrine Tech Tree page to see what you want to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME91075126;Advanced Division Reorganization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91075126;We now have enough battle experience to choose upon a an entirely different makeup of what a Land Division should be.  There are three choices and each has their advantages and drawbacks.  A Pentomic Division has the capability to deliver a lot of firepower at the expense of mobility but it contains a lot of combined arms units.  The Combat Brigade Division is one which offers a little bit of both mobility and firepower.  The Kampfgruppe Division offers good mobility and firepower in a medium sized formation on the battlefield.  Check the Advanced Organization Tech Tree to see which one you would rather have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME91075127;Advanced Special Forces;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91075127;Now that we have been using Special Forces for a while we can pick a dedicated direction in which we want our Special Forces to concentrate within a particlar warfare area.  Once you decide upon which type of Special Forces you would rather have, you will find them particularly useful in their special warfare area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
